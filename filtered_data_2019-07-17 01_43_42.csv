Although the Games originated in ancient Greece, the modern version migrates to a different city every four years, drawing hoards of visitors wherever it turns up. This summer, the Games will be in Beijing. The next winter Olympics will be in 2010 in Vancouver, British Columbia. - But many events that happen in the same place year after year also merit a visit. Here are a few worthy of your travel calendar - if not for this year, maybe next.

The race coincides with the annual migration of more than a million wildebeests into the Serengeti.

   Antarctic cruises


   Late fall through winter


   Antarctic cruises have become enormously popular thanks to March of the Penguins and global warming (see it before it's gone). Cruises begin in late fall and continue through the winter (which is summer in the Southern Hemisphere). You won't get close to the breeding grounds on a cruise ship, but judging from the number of pictures of penguins posted on the Web by Antarctic tourists, you'll spot plenty tuxedoed birds. Information: www.cruises.about.com/od/ antarcticacruises.


   Whale watching


   Pacific Ocean


   December and January; March and April


   Late in the year, you can catch whales migrating south from Alaska to Baja California. In spring, you can watch them return north. Since whales tend to hug the coastline, they are visible from land (if you have a pair of good binoculars), but countless whale- watching boat tours help people get up close and personal. Good lookout points are Depoe Bay, Ore. (www.whalespoken.org) or Point Reyes, Calif. (www.areaparks.com, click on California, then Point Reyes). The Dana Point (Calif.) Festival of Whales is March 1-2 and 8-9. Information: www.dpfestivalofwhales.com.


   Whale watching in Hawaii: From Christmas through mid April whales are plentiful and readily visible from Maui's verdant hillsides. McGregor Point Lookout on Route 30 is particularly reliable, but many boat tours stand ready to take you closer. For starters, try the Pacific Whale Foundation atwww.pacificwhale.org.

12,284122990,,            ,"Orlando Sentinel; Orlando, Fla.","Jan 13, 2008","United States, Orlando, Fla.",Newspapers,NEWSPAPER,,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/284122990?accountid=4840,,General Interest Periodicals--United States,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil -- Everyone knows Rio de Janeiro's carnival is supposed to be the greatest party on Earth, but to many, the hordes of sweaty, scantily clad bodies on display can be as intimidating as they are inviting. The locals have barely recovered from their New Year's hangovers and are already preparing for the five-day-long, no-holds-barred pre-Lenten bash that sweeps over this seaside city like a tidal wave. For the carnival, which takes place during the first five days of February this year, there are basically three ways to celebrate: party in the street, watch the Samba parade from the stands or -- for the truly fleet-footed and daring -- dance in the parade itself. Most of the larger samba groups allow tourists to join their contingents as long as they wear the costumes, known as ""fantasias."" The groups sell them to revelers via the Internet and at the city's larger hotels, delivering them to the customer's doorstep. The elaborate costumes can cost anywhere from less than $300 to more than $1,400, and provide revelers with a very different perspective. The upside of parading is the thrill of singing and dancing under the stadium's bright lights before a huge crowd. The downside: Once the parade is over, revelers are left standing outside the stadium in a brilliant, slightly silly-looking getup, with few options aside from returning to the hotel to watch the rest of the parade on TV. ""In my opinion it's one of the most fantastic celebrations on Earth. If you've seen anything about it on television or in print, it's all that but 20 times better,"" says Arthur Martinez, a retired U.S. Postal Service executive from Indio, Calif. ""It takes about seven minutes to get into the mood. The samba is just so infectious. ""You don't have to learn to samba, but it's a good idea if you do,"" explains Martinez, who got his first taste of Rio's carnival back in 1978. Brazilians like foreigners to at least try to dance. Of course, they laugh at all the misguided footwork, but it's better to loosen up than to be wallflowers. A capacity crowd of 88,500 watches from the stands of the Sambadrome stadium, where top-tier samba groups present their elaborate parades, the centerpiece of Brazil's annual carnival celebrations. But most of the dancing goes on below, on the stadium's nearly half-mile-long runway, where the city's top 12 samba groups each mount 80-minute spectacles featuring hundreds of drummers, thousands of dancers and about a dozen over-the-top parade floats. A cheap and easy way to celebrate is to take part in Rio's street carnival. No tickets or costumes are required to fall in behind one of the many ""bandas"" and ""blocos"" that ply the city's streets during carnival time. ""Bandas"" play hits of carnivals past, while ""blocos"" write a new song for each carnival which they repeat endlessly. The Banda de Ipanema -- one of the most famous carnival bands and a favorite of the city's gay community -- parades along Ipanema beach on carnival Saturday and Tuesday -- this year Feb. 2 and 5. Fans of the Carmelitas bloco like to dress as nuns -- though habits are not required. The group parades on Friday night, attracting a good-sized crowd to the hilltop Santa Teresa neighborhood. And the Cordao de Bola Preta, one of the city's most traditional carnival bands, packs the city's center on Saturday morning, making it a favorite for families with young children.

""My show is basically like Carnival coming to your city. If you come to a Wyclef show, you're going to be jumping for three hours."" Three hours is a long show, but if anybody can keep it interesting, it's Jean, whose music ricochets from hip-hop to folk, reggae to salsa to rock, and oftentimes is an amalgam of those styles all at once. On this tour, the former Fugee is backed by a full band, bolstered by a successful new album -- ""Carnival II: Memoirs of an Immigrant"" -- and re-energized. ""When you're having a dry period, sometimes you question your relevance, not on the music, but on the trends and how things are changing,"" he says. ""So when the Shakira record came out"" -- ""Hips Don't Lie,"" on which Wyclef dueted -- ""and I was told that it broke Michael Jackson's and Elvis Presley's record for airplay, it put a battery pack on my back and reminded me that I am relevant. I became a 14-year-old kid again."" His native Haiti shaped his musical mind-set, his activist worldview and -- for our purposes here -- his palate. Haitian food is as diverse as Jean's songs -- a jumble of ingredients, spices, cooking styles and regional influences. ""Our food is fish and rice and beans and vegetables all mixed together,"" he explains. ""There's a lot of Caribbean influence, a lot of spices and seasonings. What makes Haitian food different is that it's organic. If a Haitian house is serving chicken, it's fresh chicken."" His favorite Haitian dishes include legume (a stew) and red snapper. Regrettably, there are few local options for Haitian fare. ""I don't think there is a Haitian restaurant in Chicago,"" says Jean Auguste, who is with the Consulate General of the Republic of Haiti in Chicago. He recommends Evanston's Me Voici (741 W. Howard, 847-869-7172), where owner Marejo Mardy takes pride in her goat with rice and beans. So we sought out red snapper near the House of Blues and didn't have to look far. Redfish (400 N. State St. 312-467-1600) is a stone's throw from the venue. The Redfish menu is Creole, but there are strong similarities between the grub of New Orleans and Port-au-Prince, thanks to the French influence on both cities. I dived into a horseradish-crusted fillet of red snapper with steamed vegetables and sweet-potato fries ($20), washing it down with a Bud in lieu of Wyclef's favorite Haitian brew, Prestige. Unlike those dining around me, I declined to wear a string of shiny beads, seeing as how this was a Wednesday night in January in Chicago, not Mardi Gras in New Orleans or Carnival in Rio de Janeiro -- or a Wyclef Jean show.

The latest piece, by well-known Brazilian artist Rivane Neuenschwander, has audiences chuckling. Titled ""Quarta-Feira de Cinzas/Epilogue"" (""Ash Wednesday/Epilogue,"" in English), the five-minute video, shot in extreme close-up by filmmaker Cao Guimaraes, shows a forest floor littered with confetti. (Ash Wednesday is the day after Brazil's famous Carnival parties.) As we watch, various ant species begin to gather up the brightly colored dots, fighting over them and finally dragging them down into their nests. Our waste becomes their treasure; our play is their hard work. How did you get the ants to clean up the confetti? I had to prepare a little sauce for them! I think I tried both pork fat -- like a salami flavor -- and honey mixed with water. They pick up a piece of paper because they're attracted by the smell, and then they carry it to the nest. But there are also some ants who will pick up the paper just to clear a path. I have a brother who's a scientist, so he often tells me what animals like and how they will interact with certain kinds of smells and food.  There's a very important reference in literature here, in the book ""Macunaima"" by Mario de Andrade, to leaf-cutter ants. One of his sentences is, ""Lots of leaf-cutter ants, and little health, are the evils of Brazil."" It's a very famous quote in Brazilian culture.  In the United States or Europe, I think confetti is used for other events, too, but here it's mainly for Carnival. There's a sense that you have something colorful and playful like confetti, but in contraposition you have those ants working hard. The ants are kind of carrying the leftovers of a celebration. There's Carnival, and then afterward, the melancholic aspect of the last day of Carnival -- it's the sort of contradictory feelings that we have here in Brazil. --Interview conducted and condensed by Blake Gopnik Quarta-Feira de Cinzas/Epilogue, through April 20 at the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum, Independence Avenue at Seventh Street SW.

Home Secretary Jacqui Smith's plan would increase the limit for detaining suspects without charge from 28 days and urge judges to impose stiffer sentences on criminals whose offenses are linked to terrorism.    The proposal also calls for creation of a specialist national database to store DNA samples from suspected terrorists. Samples are not currently added to a national database holding DNA information on criminals, so officers cannot search quickly for potential matches to other evidence.    The Home Office said officials with access to the database would be vetted and subject to a comprehensive audit trail. Current laws allow top law enforcement and customs supervisors to authorize the covert collection of DNA from suspects.    Brazil    Church slams Carnival plan to hand out contraceptives    The northeastern city of Recife will be the first to hand out morning-after birth control pills during this year's festive Carnival, prompting condemnation from the church Thursday in the world's largest Roman Catholic country.    Pills will be given out at public health centers throughout four days of wild partying that begin Feb. 2, according to Mayor Joao Paulo Lima e Silva. The city hosts one of Brazil's most colorful and frenzied carnivals.    ""The church has nothing against having fun during carnival, but the banalization of human sexuality is something we cannot tolerate,"" said Bishop Antonio Augusto Dias Duarte of the Life and Family Commission of the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops.    Though the pill is marketed as a contraceptive, critics say it prompts abortion. The church opposes both.    City officials counter that pills will not be given out wantonly, rather for cases of rape and broken condoms.    Iran    Security Council powers agree to increase sanctions    Major U.N. Security Council powers have agreed on an incremental increase in sanctions on Iran, including a new restriction on exporters doing business with the country, diplomats said Thursday.    A draft resolution also calls for more monitoring of Iran's military and financial institutions, broader travel bans on Iranian nuclear scientists and other key officials and freezing the assets of people and banks linked to weapons proliferation, Security Council diplomats told The Associated Press.    Diplomats from the five nations with veto power on the council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - spent a third day negotiating a final agreement on principles that would form the basis for a third round of U.N. sanctions on Iran. They were joined by Germany, which has long been involved in efforts to resolve the Iran nuclear dispute.    France    Tens of thousands protest  job cuts, demand higher pay    Tens of thousands of civil servants demonstrated around France on Thursday to protest job cuts and press for higher salaries in what the government dismissed as a ""labor union ritual.""    Teachers, hospital workers, firefighters and postal workers were among those who answered the call from seven of eight public servants' union to strike and march.    Across the country, about 400,000 people took to the streets, according to the CGT labor union. They jammed streets in Paris, Lyon, Toulouse, Bordeaux and in the southern port city of Marseille.    Unions claimed up to 40,000 people marched in Paris, while police put the figure at 17,000.    Union leader Francois Chereque asked the government to open salary talks and complained that President Nicolas Sarkozy has failed to deliver better buying power to the French.    Colombia    Rice, union members meet  in effort to revive trade deal    Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's trip to Colombia accompanied by Democratic lawmakers is the latest, and highest- profile, visit in the White House's bid to revive a trade deal with the world's most dangerous country for labor organizing.    Rice arrived in Colombia's capital of Bogota on Thursday and from there headed in a caravan with the 10 lawmakers to the city of Medellin. The delegation met late Thursday with Colombian union members to discuss the trade deal, but details of the meeting were not released.    The White House is pushing for approval of the agreement over the opposition of the majority Democratic leadership in Congress, who say President Alvaro Uribe hasn't done enough to curb violence against trade unionists. { SB",DIGEST: [BROWARD METRO EDITION],4,4610,britain government unveils tough antiterrorism proposals british government revealed sweeping plans thursday toughen terrorism

26,2222758235,,"CARNAVAL starts Friday in Brazil, so you can bet that tourists have already started to flood into Rio de Janeiro, Salvador and Recife, Brazil’s three most famous headquarters for pre-Lenten hedonism.

And just as assuredly, local residents have begun to flood out. Some flee the chaos to quiet beach or mountain retreats, but many head to other navels of navel-baring across the country, less famous to American tourists. Some are small-town versions of the big-city celebrations; others march to the beat of their own cross-dressing drummer. 
You could still make it for this year; though with last-minute flights starting at more than $1,000, you may want to spend this weekend dreaming about Carnaval 2009. (That’s Feb. 20 to 25.) Whenever you go, BACC Travel, (800) 222-2746 or www.bacctravel.com, an agency specializing in trips to Brazil, is a good place to start planning. Its bilingual agents often have access to cheaper flights to Brazil than Web sites like Expedia and Travelocity and are knowledgeable about travel within Brazil. 
Here are a few of the more popular alternative carnivals:
Laguna
About 75 miles south of the state capital of Florianópolis, this town of 50,000 sits on the tip of a peninsula with the Santo Antônio Lagoon on one side and the Atlantic on the other. It plays host to one of the top carnivals in southern Brazil. 
The locals like to think they have the best of all worlds here: whereas Rio’s carnival is best known for its pay-to-enter parades in the Oscar Niemeyer-designed Sambódromo, and Salvador has a traditional street carnival, Laguna places equal importance on both (albeit on a much smaller scale). The town’s samba schools compete in the 8,000-person Sambódromo (where entrance is 10 reais, or $5.70 at about 1.75 reais to the dollar), but the streets also fill with “blocos,” the dancing masses that follow trucks outfitted with sound systems and platform stages where bands play samba and other Brazilian music. (To join in, you typically must purchase the bloco’s uniform, or abadá.) One prime attraction is the Bloco da Pracinha, which sets out on Sunday from the neighborhood of Magalhães and makes its way to the beach, with tens of thousands of followers in tow. 
There is also a third, more family-friendly venue: a stage set up at the city’s main beach supports bands playing sambas and other traditional carnival rhythms like axé (from Bahia) and frevo (from the northeast) as well as the old-fashioned carnival marches known as marchinhas. 
Visitors to Laguna can get there by bus from Florianópolis, and stay in hotels on the beach side of town or in the picturesque colonial town. Both www.lagunabrasil.com.br and www.laguna.sc.gov.br offer information in Portuguese.
São Luiz do Paraitinga
This small town in São Paulo state’s interior is about 115 miles from the capital and only 30 miles down the road from the popular beach resort of Ubatuba. Carnaval went on a 60-year hiatus here starting in the 1920s, when an Italian priest did away with it on moral grounds. But things started up again in 1981, and now the town is known for having one of the best old-fashioned street carnivals around. 
An official decree actually prohibits more modern rhythms like samba and axé; the official music genre of the blocos here is the traditional marchinha, or carnival march, which dates back to the 1920s and was a staple of Carnaval through the mid-20th century. Over 1,500 local marchinhas have been composed locally since Carnaval started again, and you’ll hear many of them.
The costumes worn by the blocos are similar to carnivals across the country, with bloco-specific themes, which this year include everything from babies to bus drivers.
Visitors can stay at one of the pousadas  or inns  in or near town (make reservations five or six months in advance), or rent a house from one of the residents who leave during that time. Information (in Portuguese only; click on pousadas for lodging) is at www.saoluizdoparaitinga.sp.gov.br. 
Ouro Preto and Diamantina
Ouro Preto is a stunning former gold-mining town of cobblestone streets and 18th-century colonial churches in the hills of Minas Gerais. But, and this is important come Carnaval time, it’s also a huge college town. 
Visitors can stay in the hotels and pousadas around town, but another option for the younger set is to stay in student housing (known as repúblicas), which present their own mini-carnivals. Pay one price and you’re in for five days  with a guarantee of a mattress, bathroom access, and little else. Oh yeah, and free beer, which they call cerveja liberada, as if the beer elsewhere in town was being held for ransom. 
You can skip between your own private carnival and the more traditional one on the streets  complete with blocos playing samba and axé, and plentiful cross-dressers making merry  as well as a series of more family-oriented nightly outdoor concerts called the Candonguêro Project. 
Diamantina is a similarly beautiful town, though as its name indicates, its mining industry revolved around diamonds. Here Carnaval has less of a college vibe, with the focus on the street carnival, which includes a popular local samba band called Bat Caverna (as in the place they keep the Batmobile). Many residents rent out their houses for visitors. 
Information on Ouro Preto is available (in English) at www.ouropreto.org.br and on Diamantina (Portuguese only) at www.diamantina.com.br and www.karnaval.com.br. 
Morro de São Paulo
If you do go to Carnaval in Salvador, but it’s not quite enough for you, consider tacking on an after-party variously known as a pós-Carnaval or ressaca (Portuguese for hangover). One of the most popular among the country’s harder-partying youth takes place in Morro de São Paulo, a village (and popular year-round tourist destination) on the island of Tinharé, about 20 minutes from Salvador by air or about two hours by ferry. There are no cars, a few sand roads, four picturesque beaches (creatively named First, Second, Third and Fourth Beach) and a whole bunch of discothèques.
Not much is going on there during Carnaval itself  everyone is up in Salvador. But come Ash Wednesday, the place speeds right through repopulating and into overpopulating, and the party continues through the weekend. By day, beaches lined with caipirinha stands serve fruity cocktails to crowds, by night the discos with names like Pulsar and Funny in and around town throw blow-out parties  except Thursday, which is luau night, when you can dance on the beach into Friday morning.
It costs about 170 reais each way to fly from Salvador. Morro de São Paulo has a user-friendly, useful Web site in English (and other languages), www.morrodesaopaulo.com.br, with information on getting there and where to stay.",Carnaval on a Smaller

28,387638147,,            ,"South Florida Sun - Sentinel; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.","Jan 27, 2008","United States, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.",Newspapers,NEWSPAPER,,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/387638147?accountid=4840,,General Interest Periodicals--United States,"Everyone knows Rio de Janeiro's carnival is supposed to be the greatest party on Earth, but to many, the hordes of sweaty, scantily clad bodies on display can be as intimidating as they are inviting.    The city's reputation for violence and the difficulties that arise from not speaking Portuguese make it even more important that tourists get some guidance about how to jump in.    The locals have barely recovered from their New Year's hangovers and are already preparing for the five-day-long, no-holds-barred pre- Lenten bash that sweeps over this seaside city like a tidal wave.    Foreigners in the know are flocking to the hillside shantytowns, where the city's top carnival groups hold weekly rehearsals to polish this year's theme songs and to the Sambadrome stadium where free technical rehearsals offer a taste of the Samba parade with none of the glitter or glitz.    For the carnival itself, which takes place during the first five days of February this year, there are basically three ways to celebrate: party in the street, watch the Samba parade from the stands or - for the truly fleet-footed and daring - dance in the parade itself.    Most of the larger samba groups allow tourists to join their contingents as long as they wear the costumes, known as fantasias. The groups sell them to revelers over the Internet and at the city's larger hotels, delivering them to the customer's doorstep.    The elaborate costumes can cost anywhere from $282 to $1,412, and provide revelers with a very different perspective.    The upside of parading is the thrill of singing and dancing under the stadium's bright lights before a huge crowd.    The downside: once the parade is over, revelers are left standing outside the stadium in a brilliant, slightly silly-looking get-up, with few options aside from returning to the hotel to watch the rest of the parade on TV.    ""It's one of the most fantastic celebrations on Earth. If you've seen anything about it on television or in print, it's all that but 20 times better,"" said Arthur Martinez, a retired U.S. Postal Service executive from Indio, Calif. ""It takes about seven minutes to get into the mood. The samba is just so infectious.""    ""You don't have to learn to samba, but it's a good idea if you do,"" explains Martinez, who got his first taste of Rio's carnival back in 1978.    Brazilians like foreigners to at least try to dance. Of course, they laugh at all the misguided footwork, but it's better if foreigners loosen up than be wallflowers.    A capacity crowd of 88,500 watches from the stands of the Sambadrome stadium, where top-tier samba groups present their elaborate parades, the centerpiece of Brazil's annual carnival celebrations.    But most of the dancing goes on down below, on the stadium's nearly half-mile-long runway, where the city's top 12 samba groups each mount 80-minute long spectacles featuring hundreds of drummers, thousands of dancers and about a dozen over-the-top parade floats.    For tourists, the biggest problem with trying to watch the celebrations is that the Sambadrome is in a tough part of town, and parade tickets usually sell out months in advance. There are still plenty of tickets available through travel agencies and scalpers, but at a hefty premium.    Coimbra Sirica, a public relations executive from Northport, N.Y., chose to go through a travel agent, who provided transportation to and from the stadium, because she wanted her young children to experience Rio's carnival without worrying about security.    ""The most exciting thing was to watch my children start the evening with their bodies slightly stiff and by the end of the evening they were dancing wildly, unreservedly,"" she explained. ""I love the country, I love but music but I have some concerns about safety.""    Sirica and her family, who visited last year, also followed local advice to leave valuables behind and bring only a bit of pocket money to the parade.    An easier and cheaper way to celebrate is to take part in Rio's street carnival.    No tickets or costumes are required to fall in behind one of the many bandas and blocos that ply the city's streets during carnival time.    Bandas play hits of carnivals past, while blocos write a new song for each carnival which they repeat endlessly.    The Banda Ipanema - one of the most famous carnival bands and a favorite of the city's gay community - parades along Ipanema beach on carnival Saturday and Tuesday - this year it's Saturday and Feb. 5.    Fans of the Carmelitas bloco like to dress as nuns - though habits are not required. The group parades on Friday night, attracting a good-sized crowd to the hilltop Santa Teresa neighborhood.    And the Cordao de Bola Preta, one of the city's most traditional carnival bands, packs the city's center on Saturday morning, making it a favorite for families with young children.    Some of the bigger blocos have become victims of their own success in recent years, attracting crowds so large that even the musicians have trouble breaking through the gridlock.    If all that sounds like too much trouble, there is always the path of least resistance: stay on the beach and wait for the party to come to you.

But she has another goal in mind as well. In preparation for Rio's five-day carnival blowout in February, she's having her 42nd plastic surgery -- closing in on the Guinness World Record of 47 surgical procedures held by 52-year-old American Cindy Jackson, who calls herself a ""Living Doll"" and now promotes her own skin-care  line. ""I always was vain,"" Bismarchi, 36, acknowledges at the medical clinic near Rio where her plastic-surgeon husband has operated on her 10 times. ""And for carnival, you have to feel especially pretty."" Just days before Brazil's Feb. 2-6 carnival begins, Bismarchi will have nylon wires implanted in her eyes to give them an Asian slant, in line with this year's theme of her samba group, Porto da Pedra: the centennial of Japanese immigration to Brazil. Bismarchi's unabashed passion for plastic surgery has made her a celebrity in this image-mad country, where even the poor get surgical enhancements on the installment plan. Brazilians see no shame in touching up their bodies, which are routinely exposed at carnival and flaunted on the beach in thong bikinis so tiny they're called ""dental floss."" Born poor in Rio, Bismarchi had her first cosmetic surgery in 1992 after her daughter was born. She was just 21, but said she was depressed after giving birth because her breasts began to sag. So she had them lifted, adored the results and became so fascinated with cosmetic surgery that her next two husbands were plastic surgeons. ""I put in a prosthesis and loved it. I was beautiful and sensual again,"" said Bismarchi, a striking figure at 6 feet -- taller in white high heels -- with long blond hair flowing over her white minidress. Bismarchi promotes an exclusive line of sexy lingerie, gives beauty tips and responds to the 500 to 700 letters and e-mails she receives each day. She does 21/2 hours of exercise daily, takes dance lessons and spends hours tanning on the beach. ""I consider myself quite timid. I'm just a little girl grown big,"" she said. ""I never imagined I would be famous. Things just happened.""

I was beautiful and sensual again,"" Bismarchi said, a striking figure at 6 feet - taller in white high heels - with long blond hair flowing over her white minidress.    Carnival has a special place in Bismarchi's career.    She first made headlines in 2000, when police tried to arrest her after she paraded partly nude with the Brazilian flag painted on her body.    ""I became famous all over,"" she said. ""The power of carnival is amazing.""    Two years later, she paraded with the face of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva painted across her exposed body. Police released her after she explained it was a gesture to Lula's anti- hunger program.    A wardrobe malfunction at last year's carnival put Bismarchi back in the news - when her G-string broke and dangled from her waist, Porto da Pedra was threatened with a penalty for total nudity, forbidden under parade rules. But the resourceful Bismarchi hid from the judges behind the drum section, changed her tiny ""sex cover"" and finished the parade.    Today, Bismarchi promotes an exclusive line of sexy lingerie, gives beauty tips and responds to the 500 to 700 letters and e- mails she receives each day.

""When I hand the key over to the Rei Momo, all the questions facing the city become his responsibility,"" Maia said, suggesting that the Momo would take care of civil servants' low salaries and potholes with a wave of his scepter.    The carnival king and queen rode in with their princesses in a horse-drawn carriage in the pouring rain to receive the key at the City of Samba, a complex of warehouses where top samba groups prepare their floats.    Despite the official carnival opening - four days earlier this year - banks, businesses and government offices remain open this week. The high point of the celebration starts Sunday, when the city's top 12 samba groups mount 80-minute long parades in hopes of being declared this year's champion.    In most Brazilian cities, the celebrations run until Ash Wednesday, when Catholics traditionally give up meat and promise to live more circumspectly. In Salvador da Bahia, the celebrations run beyond Ash Wednesday, despite church protests.    Salvador had a minor controversy when its Rei Momo, Clarindo Silva, weighing just 128 pounds, was elected king despite a city requirement that the Momo weigh at least 265 pounds.    Exclusively fat carnival kings have been a thing of the past in Rio since 2003 when Maia, in a bow to public concerns about growing obesity, relaxed a requirement that Rio's carnival king weigh over 300 pounds.    Alex de Oliveira, serving as Rio's carnival king for the 10th consecutive year, once weighed 500.44 pounds, but has trimmed down to 161 pounds through stomach-staple surgery.    To be declared carnival king, a candidate must display charm and personality - and know how to dance the samba. { SB",CARNIVAL KING HANDED KEYS TO RIO AS PARTY BEGINS EARLY: [BROWARD METRO EDITION],8,1893,mayor cesar maia kicked rio de janeiros annual carnival tuesday handing key city rei momo carnival king jokingly putting charge solving citys problems hand key rei momo questions facing city become responsibility maia said suggesting momo would take care civil servants low salaries potholes wave scepter carnival king queen rode princesses horsedrawn carriage pouring rain receive key city samba complex warehouses top samba groups prepare floats despite official carnival opening four days earlier year banks businesses government offices remain open week high point celebration starts sunday citys top samba groups mount minute long parades hopes declared years champion brazilian cities celebrations run ash wednesday catholics traditionally give meat promise live circumspectly salvador da bahia celebrations run beyond ash wednesday despite church protests salvador minor controversy rei momo clarindo silva weighing pounds elected king despite city requirement momo weigh least pounds exclusively fat carnival kings thing past rio since maia bow public concerns growing obesity relaxed requirement rios carnival king weigh pounds alex de oliveira serving rios carnival king th consecutive year weighed pounds trimmed pounds stomachstaple surgery declared carnival king candidate must display charm personality know dance samba sb,United States,2008,mayor cesar maia kicked rio de janeiros annual carnival tuesday handing key city rei momo carnival king jokingly putting charge solving city problem hand key rei momo question facing city become responsibility maia said suggesting momo would take care civil servant low salary pothole wave scepter carnival king queen rode princess horsedrawn carriage pouring rain receive key city samba complex warehouse top samba group prepare float despite official carnival opening four day earlier year bank business government office remain open week high point celebration start sunday city top samba group mount minute long parade hope declared year champion brazilian city celebration run ash wednesday catholic traditionally give meat promise live circumspectly salvador da bahia celebration run beyond ash wednesday despite church protest salvador minor controversy rei momo clarindo silva weighing pound elected king despite city requirement momo weigh least pound exclusively fat carnival king thing past rio since maia bow public concern growing obesity relaxed requirement rio carnival king weigh pound alex de oliveira serving rio carnival king th consecutive year weighed pound trimmed pound stomachstaple surgery declared carnival king candidate must display charm personality know dance samba sb,mayor cesar maia kicked janeiros annual tuesday handing key rei momo king putting charge problem hand key rei momo question facing become responsibility maia momo would take care civil servant low salary wave king queen princess carriage pouring rain receive key complex top group prepare float despite official opening four earlier bank business government office remain open week high point celebration start top group mount minute long parade hope declared champion brazilian celebration run ash wednesday catholic traditionally give meat promise live salvador da bahia celebration run beyond ash wednesday despite church protest salvador minor controversy rei momo silva weighing pound elected king despite requirement momo weigh least pound exclusively fat king thing past since maia bow public concern growing relaxed requirement king weigh pound alex oliveira serving king th consecutive weighed pound pound surgery declared king candidate must display charm personality know dance sb

A judge on Thursday blocked a carnival float meant to show that the Holocaust ""gives you goose bumps.""    Viradouro, the top Rio samba group responsible for the float, said it was designed to remind carnival visitors of past horrors to prevent them from happening again.    But Jewish leaders were outraged. The Jewish Federation of Rio de Janeiro sued under federal laws prohibiting Nazi propaganda and racism in Brazil, said Lara Voges, a court spokeswoman.    ""It's inadmissible that they could have a parade float depicting dead Jews and a live Hitler on top of them,"" said federation spokesman Jose Roitberg.    Rio de Janeiro state Judge Juliana Kalichszteim called Viradouro's plans a ""clear trivialization of barbaric events.""    Carnival ""should not be used as a tool for the cult of hate, any form of racism,"" the judge said.    Rio's two-night Samba parade, featuring thousands of scantily clad and elaborately plumed dancers, is the high point of Brazil's carnival celebrations and is televised nationally in a country of 185 million people.    During the event, Rio's 12 top-tier samba groups each present an 80-minute parade featuring hundreds of drummers and thousands of dancers to compete to be the year's champion.    Each group chooses a theme reflected in music, costumes and floats.    Viradouro, which is scheduled to parade early Monday, chose the theme, ""It Gives You Goose Bumps,"" featuring floats depicting the shock of birth and cold, along with the pile of Holocaust victims.    Although the samba group refused to say whether it had planned to have a dancing Hitler, it was listed in the official parade description as part of the float.    According to Kalichszteim's decision, the group would face fines of $113,000 if it ignored her order by parading with the mannequins and $28,000 for each dancer dressed as Hitler.    News of the float drew worldwide attention. Earlier this week, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an international Jewish human rights organization, issued a statement of protest.    On Wednesday, a second-division samba group agreed to remove swastikas from dancers' costumes following complaints. { SB",RIO JUDGE BANS FLOAT DEPICTING HOLOCAUST: [BROWARD METRO EDITION],4,2276,simulated pile naked emaciated corpses dancing hitler worlds biggest street party judge thursday blocked carnival float meant show holocaust gives goose bumps viradouro top rio samba group responsible float said designed remind carnival visitors past horrors prevent happening jewish leaders outraged jewish federation rio de janeiro sued federal laws prohibiting nazi propaganda racism brazil said lara voges court spokeswoman inadmissible could parade float depicting dead jews live hitler top said federation spokesman jose roitberg rio de janeiro state judge juliana kalichszteim called viradouros plans clear trivialization barbaric events carnival used tool cult hate form racism judge said rios twonight samba parade featuring thousands scantily clad elaborately plumed dancers high point brazils carnival celebrations televised nationally country million people event rios toptier samba groups present minute parade featuring hundreds drummers thousands dancers compete years champion group chooses theme reflected music costumes floats viradouro scheduled parade early monday chose theme gives goose bumps featuring floats depicting shock birth cold along pile holocaust victims although samba group refused say whether planned dancing hitler listed official parade description part float according kalichszteims decision group would face fines ignored order parading mannequins dancer dressed hitler news float drew worldwide attention earlier week simon wiesenthal center international jewish human rights organization issued statement protest wednesday seconddivision samba group agreed remove swastikas dancers costumes following complaints sb,United States,2008,simulated pile naked emaciated corps dancing hitler world biggest street party judge thursday blocked carnival float meant show holocaust give goose bump viradouro top rio samba group responsible float said designed remind carnival visitor past horror prevent happening jewish leader outraged jewish federation rio de janeiro sued federal law prohibiting nazi propaganda racism brazil said lara voges court spokeswoman inadmissible could parade float depicting dead jew live hitler top said federation spokesman jose roitberg rio de janeiro state judge juliana kalichszteim called viradouros plan clear trivialization barbaric event carnival used tool cult hate form racism judge said rio twonight samba parade featuring thousand scantily clad elaborately plumed dancer high point brazil carnival celebration televised nationally country million people event rio toptier samba group present minute parade featuring hundred drummer thousand dancer compete year champion group chooses theme reflected music costume float viradouro scheduled parade early monday chose theme give goose bump featuring float depicting shock birth cold along pile holocaust victim although samba group refused say whether planned dancing hitler listed official parade description part float according kalichszteims decision group would face fine ignored order parading mannequin dancer dressed hitler news float drew worldwide attention earlier week simon wiesenthal center international jewish human right organization issued statement protest wednesday seconddivision samba group agreed remove swastika dancer costume following complaint sb,simulated pile naked dancing hitler biggest party judge thursday blocked float meant show holocaust give goose bump viradouro top group responsible float designed visitor past prevent happening jewish leader jewish federation janeiro federal law racism lara court could parade float depicting dead jew live hitler top federation spokesman jose janeiro judge called plan clear event used tool hate form racism judge twonight parade featuring thousand scantily clad dancer high point celebration televised nationally country million event toptier group present minute parade featuring hundred drummer thousand dancer compete champion group theme reflected costume float viradouro scheduled parade early monday chose theme give goose bump featuring float depicting shock birth cold along pile holocaust victim although group refused whether planned dancing hitler listed official parade description part float according decision group would face fine order parading dancer dressed hitler news float drew worldwide attention earlier week simon center international jewish human right organization issued statement protest wednesday group agreed remove dancer costume following complaint sb

It's a time when ordinary rules don't apply. Poor and rich dance together. Even marriage vows are said to be widely suspended. None of that bothers Hiram Araujo, a 78-year-old gynecological surgeon who is the closest thing Rio has to an official historian of its big party. But there's one thing about Carnaval he doesn't like: the scheduling of the holiday. The festival here gets under way 50 days before Easter Sunday, a movable date based on the lunar calendar, this year March 23. That's the earliest Easter has been since 1913. For Mr. Araujo, who is cultural director for Rio's powerful Independent League of Samba Schools, that means a premature end to the summer tourist season and an ""economic disaster"" for the city. ""You'll see,"" he says, ""After this, everyone will be gone."" Mr. Araujo is leading a radical campaign to have Carnaval begin on the first Sunday in March every year. The idea has the backing of Brazil's hotel association, and most travel agencies here seem to like it, too. The thinking is that an early Carnaval means vacationers will not have had enough time to regain their financial footing after Christmas and New Year's. Mr. Araujo wants a national ""Brazilian Carnaval"" law. Under its provisions, cities could start their festivities according to ""tourist, economic or climate-related considerations."" The two-year-old fixed-date movement is up against more than 1,000 years of tradition. In Europe sometime during the Dark Ages, the feast day became linked to the Catholic calendar. In places that maintain the Catholic traditions, including New Orleans where Carnaval is known as Mardi Gras, the celebration immediately precedes Ash Wednesday. The moving date causes confusion in the U.S., too. ""Most of my emails are all about when is Mardi Gras and why is it on that date,"" says Bobbi Mannino, who works at Compucast Interactive, a New Orleans company that operates a Web site for Mardi Gras tourists. But she says she never heard anyone in the Big Easy talk about doing it differently. The Catholic Church has doubts about any changes. Fixing Carnaval's date in March would mean that, in many years, the festival's drag queens and tipsy revelers could hit Rio's streets in the middle of Lent, the period of fasting and prayer leading up to Easter Sunday. Canon Aroldo da Silva Ribeiro, the head priest at Rio's modernist Cathedral, predicts removing the festival from the ecclesiastical cycle of holy and profane would make it just another party. ""It wouldn't be Carnaval anymore,"" he says. ""It wouldn't have the same glamour."" In some other countries, the date of the festival known as Carnival (with an i) in English isn't so controversial. In Japan, crowds of around 400,000 turn out in August to watch 11 major samba schools parade, a tradition imported from Brazil in 1981. Finland's carnival takes place in June. ""Otherwise, it would be Carnival for Eskimos,"" says Harri Engstrand, head of international affairs for Finland's samba school association. The drive in Brazil for a fixed date is the result of Carnaval's transformation in recent decades from an unruly street party into a big-time commercial spectacle. The proceedings were first televised in a small way in 1960. Later, work was completed on the 70,000-seat Sambadrome, spurring a drive for ever larger and more elaborate floats to wow viewers. The rising costs of putting on the show invited still more commercialism. Nowadays, universities here even offer degrees in Carnaval management. In 2005, Rio unveiled the $50 million Samba City, a new home for the top 12 samba schools -- social organizations that build the floats and then parade with as many as 6,000 dancers and drummers in a competition to be chosen champion. The estimated 700,000 visitors expected this year will spend $510 million in the city, according to Rio's tourism office. And government economists are looking for other ways to boost its profitability. Mr. Araujo began studying Carnaval's history during Brazil's dictatorship, in 1964. He says that after writing an article praising Fidel Castro, he was threatened with imprisonment and forced to ""find a new hobby"" outside politics. Now his mastery of Carnaval's history is helping him to make the case for a fixed date. Rattling off how musical styles, rules and practices have changed since 1783, he says that ""Carnaval today is a science. It's not a party anymore."" His ideas are getting a boost from this year's unusually early start date. ""I first heard about the idea from him,"" says Carlos Ernesto Lopes, a coordinator of Carnaval in Cabo Frio, a resort of 170,000 people that has about a million visitors during Brazil's summer -- December to March. For many Brazilians, Carnaval, like Labor Day in the U.S., signals the end of vacation time. Since there are still seven weeks of summer left before March 21, Mr. Lopes predicts a ""huge loss"" for the town this year. A poll by the Rio chapter of Brazil's association of travel agents found 81% of them believed they will lose money because of the early Carnaval this year. But Carlos Alberto Amorim Ferreira, national head of the group, says his mind isn't made up. ""People forget it's a religious holiday, because they celebrate like it was a pagan one,"" he says. Now Mr. Araujo thinks a bold political stroke may be needed. In late January, he presented his idea for a new national Carnaval law to Marcelo Bezerra Crivella, a senator from Rio de Janeiro, and also a bishop in one of Brazil's most powerful evangelical Protestant churches. Although Carnaval is a ""devil's party"" to many evangelicals, they also share a fierce rivalry with Catholics. ""It would help to be allied with them,"" says Mr. Araujo. Brazil's Catholic Church, making its first pronouncement on the matter, isn't strictly opposed to a new date for the samba processions, says Dom Dimas Lara Barbosa, secretary general of Brazil's National Conference of Catholic Bishops. But, he says, a new date must come earlier, not later, to avoid occurring during Lent. He suggests January.

Notes: Informational box at end of text.


Tres tradiciones, provenientes de tres culturas muy diversas entre sí, tienen de fiesta a los floridanos por estos días. Se trata del Mardi Gras y de los carnavales de Río de Janeiro y de Barranquilla.


Estas fiestas, que durante siglos han sido las más grandes de Estados Unidos, Brasil y Colombia, convergen entre enero y febrero en el sur de la Florida, con lo que los amantes del samba, del jazz y el blues, y de los bailes tropicales se dedican al jolgorio hasta que comience el tiempo de cuaresma, en la segunda semana de febrero.


Hasta 2006 era sólo la ciudad de Hollywood, en el sur de la Florida, la que por décadas esperaba cada año la celebración del Mardi Gras, en una réplica más pequeña de la centenaria celebración de Nueva Orleáns.


Pero desde 2007, los colombianos residentes en los tres condados de Miami-Dade, Broward y Palm Beach se dan cita para celebrar el Carnaval de Barranquilla, que en 2008 comenzó el pasado 26 de febrero. Y ahora, luego de dos años de receso total, el Carnaval de Río vuelve al condado de Broward, con lo que se suma a la celebración cultural de comienzos de año.


Pero además de las coincidencias de tiempo, las tres tradiciones tienen otras, como que todas fueron introducidas a sus respectivos países por los colonizadores europeos, y con el tiempo se convirtieron también en representación de la cultura africana que se refleja en la música, los ritmos y la representación del denominado Rey Momo.


Río en Fort Lauderdale


El próximo 2 de febrero Brasil comienza las celebraciones del Carnaval de Río de Janeiro, que se extenderá hasta el martes 5, justo la víspera del miércoles de ceniza o inicio de la cuaresma.


Aun cuando la televisión por cable permite que el mundo entero y por supuesto los brasileños que residen en el sur de la Florida disfruten con nostalgia de los interminables desfiles y los increíbles disfraces, este año también podrán participar de la fiesta, pues por primera vez en 11 años se realizará en Fort Lauderdale el ""Carnaval Brazilian Fest 2008"", organizado por la artista y cantante brasileña Marta Luizza Cardoso.


Cardoso, quien llegó a Nueva York en 2001 y al sur de la Florida en 2003, decidió revivir el carnaval.


""Los brasileños realmente extrañan este festival y yo quiero traer algo de nuestra cultura a la gente del sur de la Florida"", dijo Cardoso. Por eso su propósito es convertir el Carnaval Brazilian Fest en un evento anual.


Ya en años anteriores, entre 1993 y 1997, el empresario brasileño Paulo Gualano había realizado un pequeño carnaval en el Bay Front Park de Miami, pero las múltiples ocupaciones de su propia compañía y el alto costo del evento lo llevaron a suspenderlo.


Entonces para los cariocas que residen en el sur de la Florida, el nuevo espectáculo será la posibilidad de revivir en la distancia la alegría de su país.


""A mí me encanta la idea de que traigan un poco del carnaval al sur de la Florida"", dijo María Fúlfaro, gerente asociada de mercadeo del Broward Center for the Performing Arts, en Fort Lauderdale. ""El carnaval es algo tan universal que a todos nos gustaría ver un poco del espectáculo, sentir el ritmo"", agregó esta brasileña que en los últimos años se ha convertido en una de las principales promotoras de su cultura en esta parte del estado.


Nueva Orleáns en Hollywood


Este año cuenta ya 11 desde que se reinició la celebración del Mardi Gras en la ciudad de Hollywood, al sur oriente de Broward. (El Mardi Gras es el último día del carnaval, pero en Nueva Orleáns abarca toda la celebración).


Emulando los festejos de Nueva Orleáns, donde nació la tradición hace más de 100 años, los residentes de Hollywood y los vecinos de las ciudades aledañas que disfrutan del jazz y la comida sureña inician los festejos de su propio Mardi Gras hoy sábado 2 de febrero.


Organizado por la firma Fiesta Tropicale Inc., además del goce y la celebración, el Mardi Gras tiene el propósito de unir a la comunidad y ampliar sus horizontes culturales mediante programas educativos, becas y donativos.


Al igual que años anteriores, en 2008 el Mardi Gras, los organizadores del evento donan parte de sus ganancias a entidades sin ánimo de lucro y entidades de caridad, al tiempo que ofrece espacios gratis para que diversas organizaciones locales puedan participar del festejo sin pagar.


Este año el Mardi Gras cuenta entre sus artistas con Marcia Ball, pianista y cantante de blues; Troy ""Trombone Shorty"" Andrews, designado como el mejor intérprete del año por Offbeat Magazine en 2007, y Terrance Simien, compositor e intérprete de zydeco, música folclórica del sur de Estados Unidos, entre otros. Estos artistas actuarán el martes 5, a partir de las 5 p.m., en Hollywood Beach.


La Arenosa en Miami


Declarado por la UNESCO como Obra Maestra del Patrimonio Oral e Inmaterial de la Humanidad, el Carnaval de Barranquilla se trasladó al sur de la Florida desde 2007.


Y para 2008 la fiesta de los curramberos, como se les llama a los nativos de esa ciudad colombiana, ha crecido mucho más. No sólo tienen su propia reina, Daniella Jaramillo Guerra [una estudiante de Negocios de FIU] sino una completa programación de actividades que incluye una serenata a Barranquilla en el Arienne Arsht Performing Arts Center (Carnival Center), a cargo de Chelito de Castro, desfiles a lo largo de Lincoln Road y un gran desfile de carrozas y comparsas que marca el fin de la fiesta.


El evento es organizado por O/E Arts & Culture, una fundación que trabaja para difundir las expresiones del arte y la cultura latinoamericana en Estados Unidos. Este año el Carnaval de Barranquilla en Miami contará con la aparición de artistas como Juan Piña y Wilfrido Vargas.


Pero además de estos tres países y estas tres culturas, enero y febrero son época de celebración pre cuaresma para innumerables ciudades alrededor del mundo, desde las islas del Caribe hasta la India, pasando por Alemania, España y Eslovenia.


Al final de los festejos, tanto participantes como asistentes darán paso al recogimiento de la Cuaresma, sabiendo que dentro de un año, las tradiciones seguirán con fiesta, ritmo y disfraces.

47,2222682841,,"RIO DE JANEIRO  It was the last rehearsal of the Vila Isabel samba school at the famed Sambadrome, and Natalia Guimarães, Miss Brazil 2007, wondered if she was truly ready for Carnival. ",New York Times (Online); New York,"Feb 3, 2008","United States, New York","Blogs, Podcasts, & Websites",News,Brazil New York,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/2222682841?accountid=4840,Plastic surgery; Schools; Training; Dancers & choreographers,General Interest Periodicals--United States,"RIO DE JANEIRO  It was the last rehearsal of the Vila Isabel samba school at the famed Sambadrome, and Natalia Guimarães, Miss Brazil 2007, wondered if she was truly ready for Carnival. 
She surveyed the high-energy samba dancers gliding down the avenue in five-inch high heels, sweat pouring off their bare stomachs as they gyrated their rear ends at dizzying speeds for an hour, with barely a minute’s rest.
Had the 25 flights of stairs she climbed each day in her hotel and the countless hours training with a samba queen and lifting weights been enough to prepare her for her role as a drum corps queen? 
“They say Brazilians all have some samba in their feet,” Ms. Guimarães, a 23-year-old native of Minas Gerais, said. “I didn’t have much in mine. I know it has to improve, and I’m practicing hard.”
She is hardly alone. More than ever, it is survival of the fittest at Rio’s renowned Carnival celebration  a full-tilt sport in high heels. Women, and some men, put themselves through intense training programs months in advance. Health clubs in trendy Ipanema and Leblon offer specialized pre-Carnival boot camps aimed at putting members in the best shape of the year, and perhaps their lives, for the five-day pre-Lent celebration.
“For these women, Carnival is their Olympics,” said César Parcias, a personal trainer at Proforma gym in Leblon who teaches a pre-Carnival workout class. 
Women, especially, put heavy pressure on themselves to measure up on the samba stage and in the bacchanal block parties that began winding through this city of six million people on Saturday. Sun-worshiping and visible tan lines are mandatory. Some even turn to plastic surgery for pre-Carnival adjustments. 
But for most of Rio’s residents, known as Cariocas, more is never enough when it comes to Carnival. They feel that the eyes of the world are upon them, and they do not plan on disappointing.
To that end, more flesh is on the agenda this year, too. 
“This year our costumes are tiny, and there are no feathers to cover our bums,” said Livia Candido, an 18-year-old dancer with the Vila Isabel samba school. “That means there’s a lot of pressure to get our bums in perfect shape.”
Marcelo Misailidis, a choreographer for Vila Isabel, said the demands to be physically fit for Carnival are growing. As samba schools get bigger, to ensure that the several hundred people in the group finish the parade in time, the samba rhythms have become faster, he said. The competition in the Sambadrome features 12 schools, each with 80 minutes to parade its way down samba “avenue.” Schools are penalized if they exceed that time. Each parader, known as a componente, is on the avenue for up to an hour.
Julio Cesar da Conceição, a fitness trainer and member of Vila Isabel’s samba troupe, estimated that during that hour, a componente dancing a frenetic samba could burn up to 1,200 calories and sweat up to a gallon of water in the humid, 90-plus-degree temperatures. 
Mr. Misailidis says he remembers a time not too long ago when people who paraded down the avenue were not as physically fit. “Some would pass out halfway through,” he said. “These days, people know better.” 
Just as physically demanding  especially for die-hard samba dancers  are the less formal, and often more brazen, Carnival parties and parades known as blocos. They continue for hours on end, often fueled by copious drinking. Costumes are common at these mobile parties, but they tend to be even more minimalist than the revealing sequined and feathered samba parade get-ups. 
To get the Carnival-ready body, many Cariocas swear off fried food weeks before and stock up on energy bars and energy drinks, an increasing number of which contain guaraná, a caffeine-rich plant native to the Amazon rain forest. Once the Carnival parties kick off, revelers drink huge amounts of coconut water, which is thought to have broad healing powers. 
Priscyla Vidal, a “muse” for the Bola Preto bloco, said a diet rich in black beans gave her the fuel to spend hours on the Stairmaster machine. “Carnival is all about vanity, but it has changed,” said Ms. Vidal, 27. “It used to exalt whoever could dance samba the best. Now it is more about who looks more glamorous.”
Mr. Parcias, the personal trainer in Leblon, knows that only too well. Last week, some 40 people attended his one-hour class. They were of all ages, but were mostly young women in form-fitting bodysuits. They seemed utterly focused, staring ahead at the mirror and never uttering a complaint. 
The Carnival classes, held five days a week, begin five weeks before the event. “Some people get here before Carnival and they are desperate to start training after a full year where they’ve done almost no training,” he said. “Some people go overboard, but of course we discourage that.”
Like triathletes recovering after a race, Mr. Parcias’s students will spend the six weeks after Carnival in less-intensive workouts, a “period of recuperation,” he said.
When exercise is not enough, some Brazilians go under the knife to perfect their beauty. Angela Bismarchi had her 42nd plastic surgery on Monday. Already the Brazilian record holder for the most plastic surgeries, Ms. Bismarchi, 36, had nylon wires implanted in her eyes to give them an Asian slant, to help her look the part for this year’s theme of her samba group, Porto da Pedra: the centennial of Japanese immigration to Brazil.
Ms. Bismarchi said in a telephone interview that she had timed the operation to “be much more beautiful during Carnival.” Once it is over, she said, she will have another operation to remove the wires. “I will return to being Angela,” she said.
After Carnival, Ms. Guimarães, who has focused her months of Carnival training on having a “healthier, more muscular and curvaceous” body for samba dancing, will have to transform her body again to return to the modeling world.
“I have to get skinny again,” she said. “Being in shape by New York standards, by fashion standards, means being skinny.”

Some flee the chaos to quiet beach or mountain retreats, but many head to other places for navel-baring across the country. Some are small-town versions of the big-city celebrations; others march to the beat of their own cross-dressing drummer.
You could still make it for this year; though with last-minute flights starting at very high prices, you may want to spend this weekend dreaming about Carnaval 2009. Whenever you go, www.bacctravel.com, an agency specializing in trips to Brazil, is a good place to start planning.
Its bilingual agents often have access to inexpensive flights and are knowledgeable about travel within Brazil.
Here are a few of the more popular alternative carnivals:
LAGUNA  About 120 kilometers, or 75 miles, south of the state capital of Florianopolis, this town of 50,000 sits on the tip of a peninsula with the Santo Antonio Lagoon on one side and the Atlantic on the other. It plays host to one of the top carnivals in southern Brazil.
Whereas Rio's carnival is best known for its pay-to-enter parades in the Oscar Niemeyer-designed Sambodromo, and Salvador has a traditional street carnival, Laguna places equal importance on both (albeit on a much smaller scale). The town's samba schools compete in the 8,000-person Sambodromo, but the streets also fill with blocos, the dancing masses that follow trucks outfitted with sound systems and platform stages where bands play. (To join in, you typically must purchase the bloco's uniform, or abadá.) One prime attraction is the Bloco da Pracinha, which sets out to the beach on Sunday.
There is also a third, more family-friendly venue: a stage set up at the city's main beach supports bands playing sambas and other traditional carnival rhythms like axe (from Bahia) and frevo (from the northeast) as well as the old-fashioned carnival marches known as marchinhas.
Visitors to Laguna can get there by bus from Florianopolis, and stay in hotels on the beach side of town or in the picturesque colonial town. Both www.lagunabrasil.com.br and www.laguna.sc.gov.br offer information in Portuguese.
An official decree prohibits more modern rhythms like samba and axe; the official music here is the traditional marchinha, which dates back to the 1920s and was a staple of Carnaval through the mid-20th century. Over 1,500 local marchinhas have been composed locally since Carnaval started again.
The costumes have bloco-specific themes, which this year include everything from babies to bus drivers.
Visitors can stay at one of the pousadas, or inns, in or near town (make reservations five or six months in advance), or rent a house from one of the residents who leave during that time.
Information (in Portuguese only; click on pousadas for lodging) is at www.saoluizdoparaitinga.sp.gov.br.
Visitors can stay in the hotels and pousadas around town, but another option for the younger set is to stay in student housing (known as republicas), which present their own mini-carnivals. Pay one price and you're in for five days - with a guarantee of a mattress, bathroom access and free beer.
You can skip between your own private carnival and the more traditional one on the streets, as well as a series of more family-oriented nightly outdoor concerts called the Candonguero Project.
Diamantina is a similarly beautiful town, though as its name indicates, its mining industry revolved around diamonds. Here Carnaval has less of a college vibe, with the focus on the street carnival, which includes a popular local samba band called Bat Caverna (as in the place they keep the Batmobile).
Information on Ouro Preto is available (in English) at www.ouropreto.org.br and on Diamantina (Portuguese only) at www.diamantina.com.br and www.karnaval.com.br.
Not much is going on there during Carnaval itself - everyone is up in Salvador. But come Ash Wednesday, Feb. 6 this year, the place speeds right through repopulating and into overpopulating, and the party continues through the weekend. By day, beaches lined with caipirinha stands serve fruity cocktails to crowds, by night the discos with names like Pulsar and Funny in and around town throw blow-out parties - except Thursday, which is luau night, when you can dance on the beach into Friday morning.

49,2222715498,,RIO DE JANEIRO — ,New York Times (Online); New York,"Feb 3, 2008","United States, New York","Blogs, Podcasts, & Websites",News,Brazil New York,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/2222715498?accountid=4840,Plastic surgery; Schools; Training; Dancers & choreographers,General Interest Periodicals--United States,"RIO DE JANEIRO — It was the last rehearsal of the Vila Isabel samba school at the famed Sambadrome, and Natalia Guimarães, Miss Brazil 2007, wondered if she was truly ready for Carnival.
She surveyed the high-energy samba dancers gliding down the avenue in five-inch high heels, sweat pouring off their bare stomachs as they gyrated their rear ends at dizzying speeds for an hour, with barely a minute's rest.
Had the 25 flights of stairs she climbed each day in her hotel and the countless hours training with a samba queen and lifting weights been enough to prepare her for her role as a drum corps queen?
""They say Brazilians all have some samba in their feet,"" Guimarães, a 23-year-old native of Minas Gerais, said. ""I didn't have much in mine. I know it has to improve, and I'm practicing hard.""
She is hardly alone. More than ever, it is survival of the fittest at Rio's renowned Carnival celebration — a full-tilt sport in high heels. Women, and some men, put themselves through intense training programs months in advance. Health clubs in trendy Ipanema and Leblon offer specialized pre-Carnival boot camps aimed at putting members in the best shape of the year, and perhaps their lives, for the five-day pre-Lent celebration.
""For these women, Carnival is their Olympics,"" said César Parcias, a personal trainer at Proforma gym in Leblon who teaches a pre-Carnival workout class.
Women, especially, put heavy pressure on themselves to measure up on the samba stage and in the bacchanal block parties that began winding through this city of six million people on Saturday. Sun-worshiping and visible tan lines are mandatory. Some even turn to plastic surgery for pre-Carnival adjustments.
But for most of Rio's residents, known as Cariocas, more is never enough when it comes to Carnival. They feel that the eyes of the world are upon them, and they do not plan on disappointing.
To that end, more flesh is on the agenda this year, too.
""This year our costumes are tiny, and there are no feathers to cover our bums,"" said Livia Candido, an 18-year-old dancer with the Vila Isabel samba school. ""That means there's a lot of pressure to get our bums in perfect shape.""
Marcelo Misailidis, a choreographer for Vila Isabel, said the demands to be physically fit for Carnival are growing. As samba schools get bigger, to ensure that the several hundred people in the group finish the parade in time, the samba rhythms have become faster, he said. The competition in the Sambadrome features 12 schools, each with 80 minutes to parade its way down samba ""avenue."" Schools are penalized if they exceed that time. Each parader, known as a componente, is on the avenue for up to an hour.
Julio Cesar da Conceição, a fitness trainer and member of Vila Isabel's samba troupe, estimated that during that hour, a componente dancing a frenetic samba could burn up to 1,200 calories and sweat up to a gallon of water in the humid, 90-plus-degree temperatures.
Misailidis says he remembers a time not too long ago when people who paraded down the avenue were not as physically fit. ""Some would pass out halfway through,"" he said. ""These days, people know better.""
Just as physically demanding — especially for die-hard samba dancers — are the less formal, and often more brazen, Carnival parties and parades known as blocos. They continue for hours on end, often fueled by copious drinking. Costumes are common at these mobile parties, but they tend to be even more minimalist than the revealing sequined and feathered samba parade get-ups.
To get the Carnival-ready body, many Cariocas swear off fried food weeks before and stock up on energy bars and energy drinks, an increasing number of which contain guaraná, a caffeine-rich plant native to the Amazon rain forest. Once the Carnival parties kick off, revelers drink huge amounts of coconut water, which is thought to have broad healing powers.
Priscyla Vidal, a ""muse"" for the Bola Preto bloco, said a diet rich in black beans gave her the fuel to spend hours on the Stairmaster machine. ""Carnival is all about vanity, but it has changed,"" said Vidal, 27. ""It used to exalt whoever could dance samba the best. Now it is more about who looks more glamorous.""
Parcias, the personal trainer in Leblon, knows that only too well. Last week, some 40 people attended his one-hour class. They were of all ages, but were mostly young women in form-fitting bodysuits. They seemed utterly focused, staring ahead at the mirror and never uttering a complaint.
The Carnival classes, held five days a week, begin five weeks before the event. ""Some people get here before Carnival and they are desperate to start training after a full year where they've done almost no training,"" he said. ""Some people go overboard, but of course we discourage that.""
Like triathletes recovering after a race, Parcias's students will spend the six weeks after Carnival in less-intensive workouts, a ""period of recuperation,"" he said.
When exercise is not enough, some Brazilians go under the knife to perfect their beauty. Angela Bismarchi had her 42nd plastic surgery on Monday. Already the Brazilian record holder for the most plastic surgeries, Bismarchi, 36, had nylon wires implanted in her eyes to give them an Asian slant, to help her look the part for this year's theme of her samba group, Porto da Pedra: the centennial of Japanese immigration to Brazil.
Bismarchi said in a telephone interview that she had timed the operation to ""be much more beautiful during Carnival."" Once it is over, she said, she will have another operation to remove the wires. ""I will return to being Angela,"" she said.
After Carnival, Guimarães, who has focused her months of Carnival training on having a ""healthier, more muscular and curvaceous"" body for samba dancing, will have to transform her body again to return to the modeling world.
""I have to get skinny again,"" she said. ""Being in shape by New York standards, by fashion standards, means being skinny.""",No body left untoned preparing for Carnival,18,5964,rio de janeiro last rehearsal vila isabel samba school famed

55,422222988,,            ,"Los Angeles Times; Los Angeles, Calif.","Feb 3, 2008","United States, Los Angeles, Calif.",Newspapers,News,Rio de Janeiro Brazil Brazil,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/422222988?accountid=4840,Ticket sales; Clubs; Carnivals; Corporate sponsorship,General Interest Periodicals--United States,"This evening, millions will tune in to a world-famous spectacle involving carefully choreographed moves, intense competition and fanatical spectators. Viewers will largely put aside their complaints that it has lost its authenticity and become beholden to deep-pocket sponsors. No, it's not the Super Bowl. It's Carnaval season, a time of bacchanalian bashes and a fierce determination by the city's many samba clubs to shine in the trademark parades that begin this evening at Rio's Sambodromo, the Carnaval stadium. Purists object that ""Carnaval Inc."" has devolved into an advertisement for interests as diverse as airlines, unions and milk producers -- along with organized-crime gangs. Samba clubs, or schools, seek out cash-cow sponsors to finance pageants that can cost several million dollars and months of work to assemble. ""The space for poetry, for fun, for social and political criticism, or even for pure historical themes . . . has become minimal,"" wrote Aloy Jupiara, a journalist and Carnaval specialist. ""Now most themes must have an appeal to the market."" Foreign governments have even gotten into the act. Two years ago, Venezuela's state petroleum monopoly, with the blessing of President Hugo Chavez, chipped in more than $500,000 to the Vila Isabel school, which won the competition. Outsiders may imagine raucous partyers sashaying down the streets as merry bystanders dance and sip capirinhas, the refreshing national cocktail. Such free celebrations, known as blocos, do proliferate during Carnaval season, and are enjoying a resurgence. But blocos are not part of the headliner, big-money spectacle kicking off tonight at the sold-out Sambodromo. Choice tickets can cost $500 or more. Scalpers ply their trade outside the gates. The prices have largely shut out working-class spectators. Celebrities, tourists, politicians and the beautiful people have supplanted them. Like Super Bowl fans in the U.S., most Brazilians will watch from living rooms and bars, as thousands of scantily clad dancers, raucous musicians and gargantuan floats roll ostentatiously down the concrete runway. ""The Sambodromo is too commercial,"" said Renata Cunha, who, along with her daughter, Bruna, 3, was out for one of the pre-Carnaval block parties in the Jardim Botanico neighborhood. ""They're all competing for points, after all."" The 12 top schools that will perform in all-night marathons today and Monday are judged on categories such as costumes, choreography, floats, music and story lines. The big payoffs are future sponsorships and a piece of TV rights, ticket sales, official subsidies and other revenue streams. The corporate and government money stands alongside another funding source: gambling receipts. It has long been an open secret that kingpins of the city's underground numbers racket, jogo do bicho (the animal game), have underwritten samba schools. Concern has been mounting about the influence of the narcos who battle police in the hillside favelas that are home to many samba clubs. Last month, hundreds of police raided the Mangueira favela and discovered a secret passage to its venerable samba school complex. Traffickers keen to hide their presence were said to use the concealed entryway. Police are still seeking Francisco Paulo Testas Monteiro, known as Tuchinha, samba composer and alleged dealer. Tuchinha reportedly threw a barbecue to mark the selection of his tune as the club's theme song in this weekend's Carnaval. Despite the commercialization and suspect funding, Carnaval remains an electric time. Each year, unpaid multitudes loyal to samba schools memorize verses and practice dance steps. Participants are young and old, fat and skinny, white and black and every hue in between, along with a smattering of foreign tourists who pay as much as $2,500 to make merry. Many buy their own costumes, known as fantasias. For one day, they get to strut their stuff on a global stage. During Carnaval week, the ubiquitous pounding of drums eclipses the usual clamor of urban life. Conformity and routine yield to riotous abandon. For some, life's disappointments get lost in a kind of collective ecstasy. ""I used to come with my family, all costumed as the Flintstones,"" said Glaucio Gomes, decked out as Fred Flintstone at one of the blocos that swagger through streets from ritzy Copacabana to the favelas. ""But now I'm a sad man,"" he added, seeming far from clinically depressed as he chatted up the girl standing next to him. ""My wife left me and the kids don't want to come."" Rio's rough Madureira neighborhood is the home of Imperio Serrano samba school. The fanatically loyal imperianos have put their hopes this year in the indomitable spirit of Carmen Miranda, a former Rio hat-maker who made it big, though she may be best remembered in Hollywood for her fruit-topped hats. The club chose the late movie star in a pitch for lost glory: She was also the subject of the samba theme in 1972, when the club last won the Carnival trophy. In a bow to their muse, costume designers stressed multicolored headgear: oversized fedoras, soaring admiral's hats, Inca-style crowns, broad-brimmed Mexican sombreros, matador caps -- all embroidered with a garish mix of pompoms, glitter, ribbons, stylized fruit, candles and most every other imaginable adornment. ""I did everything I could to make you love me,"" read the lament from a Miranda song on a clubhouse banner facing legions of sweaty dancers during a pre-Carnaval pep rally. Rich kids from Ipanema boogied alongside the locals, all donning the club's green and white shirts, emblazoned with Miranda's image. Some drank $2 bottles of beer and wolfed down plates of sausage with farofa, fried manioc flour. ""With this deep feeling, this great spirit of Carmen Miranda, we must triumph!"" the emcee, known as Georgie, roared over the deafening din. ""We can't lose! Everyone, to the Carnaval!"" -- patrick.mcdonnell@latimes.com -- Special correspondent Marcelo Soares contributed to this report.

She surveyed the high-energy samba dancers gliding down the avenue in five-inch high heels, sweat pouring off their bare stomachs as they gyrated their rear ends at dizzying speeds for an hour, with barely a minute's rest.   Had the 25 flights of stairs she climbed each day in her hotel and the countless hours training with a samba queen and lifting weights been enough to prepare her for her role as a drum corps queen?  ''They say Brazilians all have some samba in their feet,'' Ms. Guimaraes, a 23-year-old native of Minas Gerais, said.  ''I didn't have much in mine. I know it has to improve, and I'm practicing hard.'' She is hardly alone. More than ever, it is survival of the fittest at Rio's renowned  Carnival celebration -- a full-tilt sport in high heels. Women, and some men, put themselves through intense training programs months in advance. Health clubs in trendy Ipanema and Leblon offer specialized pre-Carnival boot camps aimed at putting members in the best shape of the year, and perhaps their lives, for the five-day pre-Lent celebration. ''For these women, Carnival is their Olympics,'' said Cesar Parcias, a personal trainer at Proforma gym in Leblon who teaches a pre-Carnival workout class. Women, especially, put heavy pressure on themselves to measure up on the samba stage and in the bacchanal block parties that began winding through this city of six million people on Saturday. Sun-worshiping and visible tan lines are mandatory. Some even turn to plastic surgery for pre-Carnival adjustments. But for most of Rio's residents, known as Cariocas, more is never enough when it comes to Carnival. They feel that the eyes of the world are upon them, and they do not plan on disappointing. To that end, more flesh is on the agenda this year, too. ''This year our costumes are tiny, and there are no feathers to cover our bums,'' said Livia Candido, an 18-year-old dancer with the Vila Isabel samba school. ''That means there's a lot of pressure to get our bums in perfect shape.'' Marcelo Misailidis, a choreographer for Vila Isabel, said the demands to be physically fit for Carnival are growing. As samba schools get bigger, to ensure that the several hundred people in the group finish the parade in time, the samba rhythms have become faster, he said. The competition in the Sambadrome features 12 schools, each with 80 minutes to parade its way down samba ''avenue.'' Schools are penalized if they exceed that time. Each parader, known as a componente, is on the avenue for up to an hour. Julio Cesar da Conceicao, a fitness trainer and member of Vila Isabel's samba troupe, estimated that during that hour, a componente dancing a frenetic samba could burn up to 1,200 calories and sweat up to a gallon of water in the humid, 90-plus-degree temperatures. Mr. Misailidis says he remembers a time not too long ago when people who paraded down the avenue were not as physically fit. ''Some would pass out halfway through,'' he said. ''These days, people know better.''  Just as physically demanding -- especially for die-hard samba dancers -- are the less formal, and often more brazen, Carnival parties and parades known as blocos. They continue for hours on end, often fueled by copious drinking. Costumes are common at these mobile parties, but they tend to be even more minimalist than the revealing sequined and feathered samba parade get-ups. To get the Carnival-ready body, many Cariocas swear off fried food weeks before and stock up on energy bars and energy drinks, an increasing number of which contain guarana, a caffeine-rich plant native to the Amazon rain forest.  Once the Carnival parties kick off, revelers drink huge amounts of coconut water, which is thought to have broad healing powers. Priscyla Vidal, a ''muse'' for the Bola Preto bloco, said a diet rich in black beans gave her the fuel to spend hours on the Stairmaster machine. ''Carnival is all about vanity, but it has changed,'' said Ms. Vidal, 27. ''It used to exalt whoever could dance samba the best. Now it is more about who looks more glamorous.'' Mr. Parcias, the personal trainer in Leblon, knows that only too well. Last week, some 40 people attended his one-hour class.  They were of all ages, but were mostly  young women in form-fitting bodysuits. They seemed utterly focused, staring ahead at the mirror and never uttering a complaint. The Carnival classes, held five days a week, begin five weeks before the event. ''Some people get here before Carnival and they are desperate to start training after a full year where they've done almost no training,'' he said. ''Some people go overboard, but of course we discourage that.'' Like triathletes recovering after a race, Mr. Parcias's students will spend the six weeks after Carnival in less-intensive workouts, a ''period of recuperation,'' he said. When exercise is not enough, some Brazilians go under the knife to perfect their beauty. Angela Bismarchi had her 42nd plastic surgery on Monday. Already the Brazilian record holder for the most plastic surgeries, Ms. Bismarchi, 36, had nylon wires implanted in her eyes to give them an Asian slant, to help her look the part for this year's theme of her samba group, Porto da Pedra: the centennial of Japanese immigration to Brazil. Ms. Bismarchi said in a telephone interview that she had timed the operation to ''be much more beautiful during Carnival.'' Once it is  over, she said, she will have another operation  to remove the wires. ''I will return to being Angela,'' she said. After Carnival, Ms. Guimaraes, who has focused her months of  Carnival training on having a ''healthier, more muscular and curvaceous'' body for samba dancing, will have to transform her body again to return to the modeling world. ''I have to get skinny again,'' she said. ''Being in shape by New York standards, by fashion standards, means being skinny.''

A deal would create the world's biggest mining company and turn Vale, already the world's biggest producer of iron ore, into a fully diversified global player. It would come at a time when strong global demand, especially from China, is likely to produce a 40-50 per cent rise in iron ore prices this year.    ""They could well take the chance to announce it during Carnaval, while the public is distracted,"" says one person familiar with the situation.    An announcement during Carnaval might attract less public attention to a deal that senior ministers oppose.    However, others close to negotiations in London say that an agreement could still be two or three weeks away.    In 2006, Vale surprised industry observers by buying Inco, a Canadian nickel miner, for Dollars 18bn. A takeover of Xstrata is expected to cost about Dollars 90bn.    Vale is understood to have secured a five-year bridging loan of Dollars 50bn and persuaded Xstrata's shareholders - including Glencore, the Swiss-based commodities trading company that is its biggest shareholder - to consider accepting about Dollars 38bn in Vale's preferential shares.    These have fewer rights than Vale's ordinary voting shares, held by the controlling group that includes Previ, the pension fund of government-owned Banco do Brasil. The government is also represented on Vale's board through shares held by the BNDES, the national development bank.    A person close to the office of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the president, said that ministers objected to the deal because it would leave Glencore as Vale's second biggest single shareholder, potentially marking the first step to a foreign takeover, and because they would prefer to see Vale spending money on projects closer to home.    But observers said the delay in securing government approval owed more to ideology than concerns.    ""This is all part of the history of the PT,"" said one market participant in Sao Paulo. The left-wing PT, or Workers' Party, came to power with President da Silva in 2003. It opposed Vale's privatisation in 1997 and its members have been involved in attempts to re-nationalise the company.    Some detect an effort to overcome such resistance in a visit by Roger Agnelli, Vale's chief executive, to Colombia last week. Alvaro Uribe, Colombia's president, said Mr Agnelli had confirmed Vale's interest in investing nearly Dollars 6bn in power generation and an aluminium plant in Colombia, although Vale later said no decision had been made.    Rumours circulating at the weekend suggested that if the deal were delayed much longer, it could be scuppered by a dawn raid similar to the move on Rio Tinto by Chin-alco and Alcoa on Friday that threatens to derail a planned takeover by BHP Billiton. Chinalco's backers at the China Development Bank were said to be looking at a stake in Xstrata.    But a senior-ranking person in Sao Paulo with knowledge of the deal said such rumours could be designed to put pressure on Vale and the Brazilian government. ""The truth is that Glencore is praying for the deal to be closed quickly,"" the person said.

Cruise Europe. Want to be ahead of a cruise trend? Cruise South America or Asia. While the Caribbean, Alaska and Mexican Riviera (Pacific coast) remain the top three cruise destinations for Americans, Europe is blossoming and South America and Asia are budding, according to a new survey by Cruise Holidays, the nation's biggest cruise agency.  ""Everyone's tired of the same-old, same-old,"" says Claudia Korenic, operations manager at the Cruise Holidays branch in Shelby Township, Mich. ""South America holds a lot of interest - Machu Picchu, Chile, waterfalls and Rio. It's different from the Caribbean. We're really getting a lot more diverse. People just want to see more of the world. ""My husband and I were just talking this morning - should we go to Europe or South America?"" An estimated 12.8 million people will cruise this year, up from 12.6 million in 2007, predicts the trade group Cruise Lines International. About 18 percent will be non-Americans, so expect a greater international flavor even on American-branded ships. Here's a rundown on cruise trends you'll see this year: * Still hot Europe. Expect a Mediterranean cruise to cost about $269 per day per person, up from $250 a day in 2007. That's similar to the cost of cruising Alaska ($259 per day) but more than cruising the Caribbean ($159 per day). The cost increase is mainly due to one thing, says Korenic - supply and demand. Popular Mediterranean cruises last about 12 days and visit spots like Rome, Turkey and Greece. Northern European Baltic cruises usually stop in ports such as Amsterdam, Scandinavia capitals and St. Petersburg, Russia. * Interesting South America and Asia cruises. Look hard and be flexible on dates, and you can dig up some great prices, as low as $2,000 for two weeks. The new ship Carnival Splendor launches in July and will sail Baltic cruises in summer, then do three South American cruises in early 2009 - one from Ft. Lauderdale - as it repositions to the West Coast for the spring ($1,799-up, see www.carnival. com) Cruise Holidays reported its South American bookings are up 23 percent this year, taking people to places like Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Its Australia and Asia bookings are up about 10 percent. Asian cruises can take you from busy Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai to remote spots in Vietnam and Thailand. * New destinations even from Florida. An estimated 17 percent of all American adults have already taken a cruise, so cruise lines keep going farther afield for new ports. One of Korenic's favorite new itineraries is on the Royal Princess, which is doing 14-day cruises round-trip out of Florida that take passengers all the way to French Guiana and the Amazon in Brazil. * New luxury small ships that appeal to cruisers looking for something new. The Pearl Sea, a 215-passenger ship debuting in August, will ply Atlantic Canada this fall (eight days for about $4,000). The Jewel River Cruises small ship Imperial Blue debuts May 15; it will run seven-day luxury cruises from Paris to Rouen on the Seine (about $5,000; see www.jewelriver cruises.com). * More ""must-see"" ports spread worldwide. Cruise Critic's top ports for 2008 are Amsterdam, Dubrovnik, Hong Kong, Martinique, Maui, Muscat (Oman), Naples (Italy), St. Petersburg (Russia), Sydney and Vancouver. The still fresh Grand Turk port on beautiful Turks and Caicos in the Caribbean is also drawing attention. Luxury cruise line Seabourn will stop this year in ports so obscure that you might not even be able to find them on a map: Opatija and Split in Croatia ; Trieste, Brindisi and Bari, Italy; Lundy Island and Isles of Scilly in Britain; and St. Raphael in France. * More exotic world cruise itineraries. * Continuation of ""flightseeing"" air tours despite four accidents in 2007 that killed 15 people in Alaska and Hawaii. * Possible softer prices. The poor U.S. economy may mean fewer Americans will be able to afford a cruise later this year despite rosy industry predictions, reports the trade journal Travel Weekly. If that happens, look for discounts. ""I've already seen some phenomenal deals,"" Korenic says.

Occasionally, though, it does something really well. Keeping HIV/AIDS under control in a country where sex rivals football as the national sport is an impressive achievement, and over the past 20 years the government has done just that. Now, however, the disease has spread across Brazil (see maps). Although the total number of cases remains low at 620,000, representing 0.6% of those aged 15-49, the change in the profile of sufferers is taking the fight to places where it will be much harder to win. ""The epidemic has now taken the contours of the general population,"" says Mariangela Simao, who runs the federal government's AIDS programme in Brasilia, the capital. ""It has become a portrait of Brazil."" Brazil's epidemic began life among gay men in the south-east of the country, probably after travelling south from the United States rather than west from Africa. Had the virus not affected some white men living in the country's most prosperous region, the response might have been less energetic, some suggest under their breath. Thankfully, it was energetic, and it has taken three forms. First, there has always been an insistence on the need to wear condoms, particularly at carnival time (when the usual supply of free prophylactics increases by 40%). The World Bank recently helped the government to buy a billion condoms (for 190m inhabitants)--around a tenth of the world's total supply. It took a year to find factories with sufficient capacity and the right quality controls to fill the order. Second, the government funds free treatment for anyone with AIDS. This has involved side-stepping patents on anti-retroviral drugs to keep the bill down. Brazil saved an estimated $30m last year through the compulsory licensing of Efavirenz, a drug developed by Merck. But this strategy has its limits: the launch onto the market of one new drug has been delayed despite undergoing some clinical trials in Brazil. Third, NGOs have been good at publicising the cause and at holding federal and local governments to their promises. This is particularly important in the north and north-east of the country where the disease is spreading fastest, and where some politicians have a semi-feudal relationship with voters. Cristina Pimenta, head of the Brazilian Interdisciplinary AIDS Association, says that NGOs are also now focused on making sure women know about the disease, get tested and, if necessary, get treated. During this year's carnival in Pernambuco, a poor state in the north-east, a government campaign was aimed almost exclusively at women. As AIDS has spread through Brazil, it has gone from being an almost exclusively male disease to one that does not discriminate by sex. The responsibility for this lies in drug users sharing dirty needles and bisexual men--35% of male HIV/AIDS sufferers who have sex with other men say they also sleep with women. As a result, women now account for ten out of every 25 new cases. Among young teenagers, more girls have the disease than boys. Women are less likely to be aware that they are at risk, too. According to one study, while 80% of men say they use a condom during casual sex, only 40% of women say their partners do. (There may be some lying here, as this suggests that the unprotected 20% of men get very little sleep. But it points to a real problem.) Brazil is still an overwhelmingly Catholic country where abortion is illegal. Persuading women in places far from the country's cosmopolitan big cities that they must get their partners to use condoms is hard. Diagnosing people with HIV/AIDS and making sure they take their medication in the correct way has also got harder with the geographic spread of the disease. Brazil's health-care system is very patchy, as a recent report by the AIDS ministry for the UN shows. Victims in the north-east of the country are significantly less likely to be diagnosed than those in the south-east. For every 100,000 inhabitants in the south-east, 27 will have an AIDS test (this excludes pregnant women, who are frequently tested), compared with just 17 in the north-east. People with HIV/AIDS live longer in the south-east than they do in the north-east. And so on. The risk is that people who do not follow their treatment correctly then develop drug-resistant strains of the virus. The disease would then become even more expensive to treat as newer drugs are required. This would come on top of the cost of regular health care for sufferers, who tend to need treatment for other health problems too. None of which means there is anything inevitable about AIDS spreading even further in Brazil. But from here on, it will all get a lot tougher.",The Americas: A portrait in red; AIDS in Brazil,2,4829,one worlds successful aids programmes faces new problems brazils government accustomed

123,208730036,,            ,Economist.com / Global Agenda; London,"Mar 21, 2008","United Kingdom, London",Magazines,News,Venezuela,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/208730036?accountid=4840,Geographic profiles; Tourism; Business etiquette; Social conditions & trends; Culture,Business And Economics--Economic Situation And Conditions,"Keeping English time (and space) in Caracas Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday Friday ""DOESN'T the proximity of Venezuelans bother you?"", a Venezuelan acquaintance asks at a party. I look puzzled. Is he talking about personal hygiene?  ""You know, the way they approach you,"" he goes on, trying to clarify the point. ""Ah, you mean the invasion of personal space?"" I suggest. He beams affirmatively. I consider the point for a second or so, and conclude that, perhaps surprisingly for someone brought up amid British reserve, I'm more bothered by the latter. That stiff-armed handshake, for instance, that maintains a prudent distance between shakers. Venezuelans, unless they actively dislike you (and sometimes, even if they do), use limbs to embrace and envelop rather than to ward off fellow humans. It can take some getting used to, if you move directly from one society to the other without anaesthesia or a period of adaptation. The man sitting next to you, for instance, may well put his hand on your knee in the course of a conversation--something that in a British pub might lead to a punch on the nose. And then there are the oddities of business relationships. I still, I admit, feel a certain unease when the (female) estate agent or insurance broker, for example, expects a kiss on the cheek after only one previous encounter. It somehow seems to erode the commercial nature of the business at hand. As Alan Bennett once memorably put it, we seem to have embarked upon a relationship of ""redundant intimacy"". Am I more or less likely to complain about the flaws in the car you just sold me if we're already on kissing terms? I'm not too sure. There are, I tell my new friend, other things that bother me about Venezuelans. Like their punctuality--or to be more precise, their total lack of it. Take this morning, for instance. I arrive at an 8am meeting a couple of minutes early. That's known in Latin America as ""English time"". Half-an-hour later, just two of the other six participants have shown up. One phones to say she's stuck in traffic and will be another 15 minutes. The meeting finally begins an hour and a quarter after the appointed time. Lateness is a self-fulfilling prophecy: aware that everyone else is likely to be late, the punctual stop making an effort. Every so often, with few if any lasting results, Latin American leaders launch punctuality campaigns. Venezuela, which has oil (and therefore perceives only a tenuous link between effort and reward), doesn't take the issue seriously. Sometimes people don't show up at all for appointments. What's worse, they seldom phone to apologise later. One thing Venezuelans tend to do on time, however, is leave work. I once tried to get a new identity card at a mobile office set up in a metro station. When I arrived, the workers were packing up the computers. ""What hours do you work?"" I asked, annoyed. ""Nine to four,"" was the laconic reply. I pointed out that the time was 3.47. ""We're already packing up,"" said the functionary, superfluously. Once they have stopped work, getting them to start again can be problematic. The whole construction industry, to take one example, shuts down in mid-December, and it's pointless trying to get any building work done until at least mid-January. By the time the New Year torpor has fully worn off, it's nearly time for the Carnival break. But, to look on the bright side, at least you might get something done in the few weeks between Carnival and Easter. There are many honourable exceptions. Plenty of Venezuelans are efficient, hard-working and responsible. It hurts them as much as it hurts me that so much time is wasted. But they're swimming against a powerful tide. The society, collectively, has an all-purpose answer to complaints about idleness and inefficiency. ""We're not Swiss,"" they say with a shrug. <hl2/> Thursday MY THURSDAY plans did not include spending six-and-a-half hours in the emergency department of a Caracas clinic, with the air-conditioning turned up so high it felt like a meat locker. But life takes unexpected turns. It wasn't even a real emergency--no broken bones, no heart attack. But as the doctor put it, if you don't come in through emergency, the insurance company won't pick up the bill for any tests you need. Even with that kind of prior warning, I admit it was something of a shock to find that admission seemed to be in the hands of a cashier instead of the medical personnel. Before any treatment took place, I had to cough up the $80 deductible established in my policy. ""And I can't offer you immediate attention,"" the cashier said curtly. ""There are five people ahead of you--it could take a while."" ""I've been here since 10 this morning,"" said the woman next to me. It was nearly five in the afternoon. ""It's just as well it's not an emergency--I'd be dead by now."" The private clinics in Venezuela are full to bursting, and their emergency departments jammed with non-emergencies. In this one, there are no beds to be had. And that's no exception, to judge by anecdotal evidence. A friend whose small grandson had a severe asthma attack, for instance, says the clinic could only accommodate him in a small cubicle in the emergency room; his mother had to sleep next to him in a chair. Treatment plus the overnight stay cost $1,200. The government says the private clinics are profiteers, trafficking in illness, and the president keeps threatening to nationalise them all. Let's hope he doesn't, because public hospitals are in a much worse state, despite official claims that giant strides have been made in recent years. The day before my trip to the clinic, one newspaper headline claimed as many as five babies shared an incubator at the capital's main maternity unit. At another Caracas hospital, a few days earlier, doctors were complaining they had to immobilise fractured limbs using cardboard boxes, because splints and bandages were in such short supply. The authorities dismiss these stories as part of a media campaign to destabilise the government. But it is impossible to disguise the collapsing infrastructure or prevent the doctors from talking, even though hospital administrators do their best to keep the press at bay. The medical federation says 2,000 doctors have left the country in the past four years. That's not surprising when you consider that a monthly salary for a full-time doctor in a public hospital is less than $400. The government's policy has been to set up a parallel system from the ground up--starting with primary health-care modules in poor barrios, staffed mainly by Cuban doctors--and to train thousands of Venezuelans in Cuban-style general medicine, graduating them in record time. But more than half of the modules are no longer staffed, and the total built is less than a third of the target figure. Even if they were all operational, that only amounts to the equivalent of one for every barrio in the capital alone. The fact that primary health-care remains precarious can be seen in the marked upswing in recent months of epidemics like dengue, and even the highly unpleasant (and incurable) Chagas disease. If you ever suffer a real emergency, your chances of survival are not great. The Caracas fire service (which attends health emergencies as well as fires) only has three working ambulances, one of which sits outside the mayor's office all day.  If you're lucky enough to get one, or if you have access to a private ambulance, you'd better hope your life expectancy without hospitalisation is measured in hours rather than minutes. Ambulances get stuck in traffic like everyone else, and paramedics complain that Venezuelan drivers are reluctant to get out of the way even for an emergency vehicle.  <hl2/><hl2/> Wednesday IMAGINE for a moment that New York, London or Paris had a forested, 3,000-metre mountain, complete with tropical climate and fauna, on their doorstep. If you ask a caraqueno what this city has that no one else does, the chances are that he or she will put the Avila Mountain high up on the list. Remarkably, despite slums that cling to almost every other slope in hilly Caracas, the Avila has remained green and mostly untouched (except for the forest fires that consume parts of its flanks every year at the height of the dry season). It is crowned by a bizarre, circular, 14-storey hotel, called the Humboldt, which was built during the dictatorship of Gen. Marcos Perez Jimenez in the 1950s and has stood empty almost ever since. Perez Jimenez also had a German company build a cable car that, in its heyday, connected Caracas with the Caribbean coast on the other side of the mountain. But the cable car was closed in 1988, and it was not until just a few years ago that the Caracas side was reopened. The private consortium that rebuilt the infrastructure was given a 30-year lease by the government (since the Avila is a national park), but then politics intervened. One of the main shareholders also had a stake in Globovision, the only remaining opposition television channel, which has an implacably anti-government editorial stance. The shareholder was jailed for a few months, after being accused (on testimony given by a man later proven to be an inveterate liar) of involvement in a political killing. Perhaps by coincidence, the government then decided to confiscate the cable car in the name of ""the people"". One day the National Guard showed up, the workers' uniforms turned revolutionary red, and the cable car's somewhat Disney-like name of Avila Magica was changed to Guarairarepano, the word the valley's indigenous inhabitants used to refer to the mountain. I'm reflecting on this turbulent recent history as I stand in the queue for tickets at the cable-car station, beside the dual carriageway known as the Cota Mil that runs along the 1,000-metre contour-line. This is where the city ends and the mountain begins. The government accused the cable car's former owners of discriminating against the poor by charging an excessively high entrance fee. The cost of a ticket has only come down from 30 to 25 bolivares. But as we paying customers creep slowly towards the only ticket window (of three) that is actually open--and apparently staffed by someone with no clue how to process credit-card purchases--a steady stream of government employees and their families is led in for free. At the top, along the narrow ridge between the cable-car station and the Humbolt hotel, little has so far changed. Except that the variety of food on offer has dwindled to rather sad-looking hot dogs and churros (pieces of sweet fried dough served with chocolate). More worrying is the thought--perhaps unjustified--that the cable-car system might not long survive the government's approach to issues such as maintenance. The Revolution, unfortunately, has a long track record of seizing property from private-sector ""oligarchs"" and landowners and running it into the ground. Its inability to maintain beef and dairy production, for instance, on the farms it has expropriated is reflected in empty supermarket shelves. I don't have much of a head for heights at the best of times, and I suspect that, as time goes by, my willingness to be suspended hundreds of metres up in a government-run cable-car will diminish. Today, though, everything runs smoothly. And when the clouds temporarily lift, and the giant Venezuelan tricolor snaps in the breeze, the view is stupendous. To the north, the Caribbean. To the south, the skyscrapers that march along the valley floor. Caracas, as they say in Spanish, tiene un buen lejos--it looks better from a distance. <hl2/> Tuesday IT IS 6.20pm and I'm contemplating one of the most familiar views in the Venezuelan capital--the tail-lights of stationary vehicles ahead of me on the westbound Avenida Francisco de Miranda, the main route through eastern Caracas. Twenty minutes ago I left a car-park 400 metres back, and I've been crawling along, wishing my car had an automatic gear-box, ever since. Plenty of time to work out that that's an average speed of, let's see, 1.2km (0.75 miles) an hour. Crammed into a narrow valley, running east-to-west, and with few cross-town routes, Caracas is an urban planner's nightmare. ""I don't know how you stand it,"" said a visiting colleague. ""I'd adopt a Pol Pot-solution: herd the inhabitants out to some remote rural spot, raze the whole thing, let it revert to jungle and start again."" Until just a couple of years ago, the city used to have rush hours. Now it resembles a parking lot for most of the day. The brief, and almost wholly unpredictable, moments of decongestion almost make things worse. A journey of just a few miles that you have calculated will take 40 minutes suddenly and mysteriously becomes a 15-minute hop that deposits you, early and unwanted, on someone else's doorstep. The reason for the congestion, on the other hand, is no mystery at all. In 2007, car sales in Venezuela, fueled by a massive increase in liquidity and negative interest rates that make saving a mug's game, rose by 81% from the year before. That followed growth of 50% in 2006 and 75% in 2005. Hundreds of thousands of new cars--a large proportion of which hit the streets of Caracas (where no new roads have been built for years)--brought traffic jams of epic proportions. Even if each car takes up only 3 metres of roadway, 100,000 cars placed end-to-end stretch for 300km. And the problem doesn't stop there. Most caraquenos seem to feel it is their constitutional right to proceed into the middle of a road junction, regardless of whether there is a space to proceed into on the other side. You can therefore sit for six or seven changes of the lights before those at the head of the queue manage to force their way through the cross-traffic. Lifestyles and behaviour have had to adapt to the new reality. Forget those breakfast meetings in another part of town: your entire morning will be taken up getting there and back. Make sure you live close to where you work (and where your children go to school). The American ambassador, for instance, last year shifted his residence across the city in a bid to reduce the hours spent every day in traffic between home and office. The opposition mayors of two of the capital's municipalities decided they had had enough of waiting for the city-wide authority and the national government to act. They came up with a plan, inspired by a successful initiative in the Colombian capital, Bogota, to take one fifth of the cars off the road each day during rush-hour, based on the last number of their licence plates. Briefly, the hellish traffic eased, and despite the inconvenience of having to leave the car at home once a week, most residents told pollsters that they supported the measure. Then the Supreme Court stepped in. In response to an initiative from one man, the judges ruled that the plan violated the constitutional right to free transit, making Venezuela (in the words of one of the mayors) the only country in the world in which vehicles have constitutional rights. Still, things might get better. The government has imposed stiff quotas on car importers, supposedly to stimulate domestic production. And with exchange controls making hard currency scarce, the supply of spare parts is drying up. Pretty soon, many of the new cars that hit the road in recent years may end up permanently parked for lack of spares. <hl2/> Monday ON A fresh, cool morning, the short walk to the panaderia and, if I'm feeling energetic, up the hill to Roberto's newspaper kiosk, is a pleasure to be savoured. A pair of boat-billed flycatchers, exchanging loud, rasping calls, perch on a lamp-post. An even louder screeching announces the arrival of half-a-dozen blue-and-yellow macaws. They're a long way from their home in the forests of Amazonas or the Orinoco delta, but like more than a dozen other species of parrot, these former cagebirds are now happily established as a wild flock in the capital. Caracas, as Gabriel Garcia Marquez once wrote, never lost its vocation as a jungle. The dictionary translates ""panaderia"" as a bakery, but that doesn't begin to describe the function of this indispensable Venezuelan institution. Indeed, these days it is often something of a misnomer, for reasons I will come to shortly. Traditionally run by Portuguese immigrants, it is a corner-store and coffee shop as well as a bakery. A place where you can buy your morning paper, grab a chair and catch up with the news while you sip the best coffee in Latin America. There are, I will grant you, nearby countries with fine coffee-producing traditions; Colombia and Brazil, to name but two. And then there is Argentina, with its Italians and their espresso machines. But only Venezuela has good coffee beans and enough European immigrants. And having endured for years the tasteless concoction that passes for a cappuccino in Mexico, I say viva! Venezuelan coffee. (The beer's awful, but that's another story.) I could buy a couple of papers at the panaderia and head back home. But Roberto keeps my copy of The Economist, whose arrival is always unpredictable and usually at least ten days late. His kiosk commands a splendid view eastwards down the valley, with the 3,000-metre Avila mountain on its northern side. And he's always ready with a sardonic quip about the government's latest lunacy, delivered in competent, Brazilian-accented English. Today, unusually, it's not politics but music that's on his mind. ""Not Sir Winston Churchill,"" he announces. ""Not Shakespeare. The greatest Englishmen were these guys."" And he holds up a CD of Beatles music.  Furnished with the morning papers--though not The Economist, which has still not arrived--I head back down the hill with breakfast on my mind. Nothing fancy, just a cup of British tea with fresh milk and a sandwich made with warm bread from the panaderia. But it's six months since I last saw a carton of pasteurised milk. And the panaderia's French loaves, when there are any, are skinny and tasteless, made with a dough I suspect contains something other than wheat flour. The government imposed price controls on basic foods and medicines several years ago, and failed to adjust them in line with cost increases. With inflation running at more than 20%, the predictable result is that the cheaper cuts of meat, along with chicken, milk, flour, cooking oil, black beans, eggs and a dozen other items are now in such short supply that fights sometimes break out when they are finally delivered. Today is a no-fresh-bread day, again. So breakfast will be sliced whole-wheat toast, and a cup of tea made with UHT or powdered milk. Minor irritants to a relatively well-off foreigner. But it's not much fun hunting for milk if you're on a low income and have small kids or elderly relatives to feed. Welcome to Venezuela.

A government effort to dispense emergency contraception in the city of Recife, where carnival festivities started in February, stirred the censure of Catholic authorities. Recife Archbishop Jose Cardoso Sobrinho warned the faithful that those who use emergency contraception face excommunication.


The pills, which prevent pregnancy when taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, were distributed at public clinics in Recife throughout the four days of frenzied partying. They were a part of the government's program that included giving out 19.5 million condoms during carnival, which ushers in the abstemious season of Lent on the Christian calendar.


The government has been distributing condoms during carnival for the past few years as part of a national anti-AIDS education campaign whose slogan, translated, means ""good in bed means wearing a condom.""


The condom campaign and the public distribution of emergency contraception in Recife represent the latest attempts by the Brazilian government to remove issues of reproductive health from the inner folds of Catholic doctrine, setting itself apart from many other nations in the region.


The biggest sign of this came a year ago, when President Luiz lnacio LuIa da Suva, who took office in 2002, appointed Jose Temporao health minister. Within days of taking office, Temporao called for abortion to be discussed as a matter of public health and women's reproductive right.


""Unfortunately, women haven't been heard on this discussion,"" Temporao said. ""There are 700 hospitalizations per day due to problems relating to abortion. I wonder: if men got pregnant, would this issue be resolved by now?""


In November, the government began distributing emergency contraception pills in Sao Paolo metro stations. The move followed a government price cut of 90 percent for birth control at pharmacies in May 2007 and it's more than doubling the number of free contraceptives it distributes through state clinics.

""We had about 800,000 Americans that flew to Brazil last year,"" said Marta Suplicy, Brazil's Minister of Tourism. ""American tourists are very important to us because they are our largest contingent of tourists.""


In New York recently to attend the New York Times Travel Show to promote the country with tourism professionals and tour operators, Suplicy shared information on the wide range of activities Brazil has to offer.


When, most Americans think Brazil, Rio comes to mind with its world famous beaches, beautiful women, Christ statue and Carnival. But Brazil is so much more. Brazil is a country of great diversity with a range of natural and cultural assets. From Rio de Janeiro to Sao Paulo, from Recife to Salvador de Bahia, every city and state has its own flavor. ""Different parts of Brazil are like being in different parts of the world,"" asserts Suplicy. Some of the reasons the tourism board recommends for making that trip to Brazil include its culture, archaeology and architecture, ecotourism, food, fashion and sports.


Although the Brazilian Tourism Board, to date, has not segmented American markets, Suplicy says they are willing to look specifically at African Americans for obvious reasons: Brazil is home to the largest African-descent population out of Africa. According to the 2000 Census, there are nearly 11 million people of African descent living in the country. And according to The Travel Industry Association of America's report on minority travelers, African Americans are interested in destinations with culturally relevant activities.


Among the highlights that Suplicy feels might be of particular interest to African Americans is the religious festival, the Festival of the Good Death. Held in honor of the Virgin Mary, the festival takes place annually in August in the small village of Cachoeira in Bahia approximately two hours from Salvador. ""You must be more than 80 years old to participate,"" says Suplicy referring to the Boa Morte Sisterhood, a group of mostly elderly women descended from enslaved Africans that participate in the event. The festival is one of the most representative expressions of religious unification in the country with its merging of Catholicism and Candomblé, an African-Brazilian religion.


Suplicy recalls being in Cachoeira and seeing five busloads of African Americans touring the city. ""I was surprised that African Americans discovered that place because it is so remote,"" she says.


Suplicy also recommends the Quilombos, secluded settlements that were formed by fugitive slaves - known as Maroons - and free-born Africans. ""(Quilombo) is the place where the slaves ran when they escaped from the farm,"" she explains. The largest and most famous was Palmares. Some have survived to this day as isolated rural communities. ""The government is investing in these places,"" adds Suplicy.


One of the country's newest developments is in Alagoas in the Northeast where an American company is building the first Black theme park in the area with Brazilian folklore characters.


Although not culturally specific, Suplicy also recommends Fernando de Noronha, off the northeast coast of Brazil.


""There are 3,500 people on the island,"" declares Suplicy. ""Only 480 people a day can enter. ""(It's a) fantastic island because of the fish. (It has) very simple places to stay. There are 5 chalets and 3 luxury apartments.""


She also recommends Recife, a city in Northeastern ""Brazil called the Venice of Brazil because of its many waterways. ""It's a sister to Relinqua where they have crafts - beautiful tours. It's a World heritage site,"" says Suplicy.


But for many African Americans interested in getting to the ""root"" of things, she agrees that Salvador de Bahia is the place to go. Known as the epicenter of Black culture in Brazil, it is a reflection of the rich cultural heritage brought from Africa to Brazil and sustained since the 16th century.


Pelhourinho, the slave trade square where slaves were publicly beaten and humiliated, is the heart of the old city of Salvador. With its cobblestone streets, colonial churches and convents, lively music and spicy local cuisine, this World Heritage Site evokes Africa at every turn. ""They restored Pelhourinho Square and now they have new hotels there,"" says Suplicy. ""They also have special music programs and wonderful restaurants.""


Salvador is also known as the birthplace of Capoeira, a unique mix of Afro-Brazilian dance and martial art, and the Candomblé religion. The city is also noted for an amazing Carnival.


For those more interested in business than pleasure, Brazil has one of the most up-andcoming economies in the world and Sao Paulo is its most important business center. A cosmopolitan city ranked among the world's finest, it offers lots of business opportunities in addition to some of the best restaurants in the country.",Brazilian Tourism Board Woos (African)

Carly Simon was worried about preserving her voice as she rehearsed for her first public performance of tunes from her latest CD, but she couldn't restrain herself as she got swept away singing the sexy title song, This Kind of Love. Tall and slender, her blond hair flowing, she gently swayed her body and snapped her fingers to the beat of the samba-inspired melody, singing passionately about making love on moonlit beaches. The CD is not only her first collection of original songs in eight years, but also finds the iconic 62-year-old singer-songwriter charting a new musical course inspired by the music of Brazil, from Antonio Carlos Jobim and Luiz Bonf to Caetano Veloso and Jorge Ben. ""I'm setting the lyrical themes to a Carnival or Brazilian or slightly samba tempo so that life is joyous even in its sadness,"" said Simon. ""Life is a dream even in its most painful moments, it's a dream that we can dance to."" ""It all kind of reminds me of Black Orpheus, which I must have seen 10 times when it came out, and was so much the impetus for my getting into Brazilian music,"" she said, referring to the 1959 film with the Jobim-Bonf score that retold the Greek Orpheus-Eurydice myth during Rio's Carnival. Simon, whose 20-year marriage to writer-businessman Jim Hart ended in divorce last year, sings of falling for someone she ""didn't see . . . as my type at all"" in This Kind of Love. The new man in her life, a surgeon who served in the Gulf War, is unlike the musicians, writers and actors she's been involved with in the past. ""Getting to know him has been quite amazing . . . because he's more capable of love than anybody that I've known with the exception of one musician who I was engaged to a while back."" During the rehearsal at a Manhattan studio, Simon put the finishing touches on new arrangements of some past hits - including the Oscar-winning Let the River Run, Anticipation and You're So Vain - realizing she can no longer sing them as hard as she did in the good old days. Simon considers her songs to be ""problem solvers"" that have helped her channel her emotions and deal with life's challenges. That was the case with her last album of original songs from 2000, The Bedroom Tapes, recorded at her Martha's Vineyard home when she was suffering from depression after battling breast cancer. ""There were some very starkly real, scary to myself, so open songs,"" said Simon. ""I love that album . . . and think it has some of the best work I've ever done."" Simon says her last label, Columbia, considered her a ""heritage"" artist and insisted she do standards albums, such as the Grammy-nominated Moonlight Serenade (2005). Simon, who had sung these songs since childhood, was the first '70s pop star - before Rod Stewart or Linda Ronstadt - to record a Great American Songbook album with Torch (1981). ""I wanted to do original songs but they thought it was safer . . . and would sell a certain number of records if I did the standards or lullabies"" on the 2007 album Into White, she said. ""I was creatively directed in that way by very well-meaning people who didn't recognize that a woman of my age has viable thoughts and feelings that people want to hear."" She got her chance when Starbucks' Hear Music label asked her to do an album of originals. She had already been thinking about a Brazilian-influenced album when Grammy-winning songwriter Jimmy Webb, who had co-produced her 1997 CD Film Noir, unexpectedly called early last year to suggest setting her old songs to Brazilian rhythms. ""I always thought that Carly had a great voice, especially in her low register, that throaty, sexy part of her voice, for that kind of music,"" said Webb, who contributed the sensuous Jobim-inspired The Last Samba for the album, which he co-produced. ""It took off in a different way because it became time for Carly to create a new project."" Simon had never stopped filling her notebook with ideas for lyrics. The Wim Wenders' film Wings of Desire inspired the sultry R&B song So Many People. The tango-flavored Sangre Dolce resulted from an encounter in Central Park with a nanny taking care of a wealthy family's baby while longing for her child back in Argentina. She wrote the slow waltz Too Soon to Say Goodbye - using a title suggested by her close friend Art Buchwald - to comfort the humorist during the months before his death in January 2007. Simon, who became a grandmother last year, was determined to make the album a family affair. She wrote Hold Out Your Heart and They Just Want You to Be There to express her strong attachment for her children - Sally, 34, and Ben, 31, both singer-songwriters. (Ben sings and plays guitar in her band.) She also performs two of their songs, Ben's Island and Sally's When We're Together. ""They just have such brilliant creativity, which I give so much credit to their genetic inputs from their father [James Taylor], who is such a well spring of amazing creativity and brilliance,"" Simon said.

Mat Rebeaud from Switzerland had to settle for second place after a hard-fought final round, with Australian Robbie Maddison claiming third in the former capital city's legendary Sambadrome. Andre Villa (NOR) remained unhurt after crashing out.A total of nine kickers spread out along a 96-metre course proved a real challenge for the world's FMX elite, a fact confirmed by winner Stenberg shortly after an emotional victory ceremony: ""Unbelievably difficult. Some of the riders here were really afraid of the course. This victory means a great deal to me. I have never seen such a challenging course. One trick went completely wrong and I thought that it was all over, but Rebeaud made a mistake too."" Despite his disappointment, Swiss high flyer Rebeaud was stoic after the final: ""That's sport for you. I had a big mistake in the final and that probably cost me victory. But it could have been a lot worse. I'm glad I didn't crash.""A heavy fall by Andre Villa (NOR) at the quarter final stage brought the vibrant crowd to a hushed silence, but the Norwegian walked away unhurt. ""I go to the gym five times a week and the muscles paid off today. I landed on my stomach, but I'll be back on the bike,"" commented Villa shortly after his fall.Backflips, heelcrackers and superman seatgrabs were among the incredible tricks on show to a capacity crowd in the city's legendary Sambadrome, where two large dirt jumps and a 'six pack' (three jumps in a row) catapulted the riders to dizzying heights.The 30,000 FMX fans were on their feet as four local riders and eight members of the international FMX elite fought it out for victory. ""I can't imagine it was even louder here during the Carnival in February,"" beamed winner Stenberg after stealing the show.After two races Mat Rebeaud (185 points) heads the overall riders' classification, with a narrow lead of just 30 points over Jeremy Stenberg (155 points).After Rio de Janeiro the Red Bull X-Fighters move stateside to Texas, USA. On July 14 the rodeo arena in Fort Worth will host the third of the tour's five stops before the most breathtaking freestyle motocross series in the world returns to Europe with a stop in Wuppertal (GER) before the traditional grand finale in Madrid (ESP).Final Results of Red Bull X-Fighters Rio de Janeiro: 1.

Caribbean Carnival kicks off Saturday. The parade event starts at Missouri and Georgia avenues at 11 a.m. and goes on until 5 p.m., ending at Euclid Street.  Hundreds of masqueraders in colorful costumes portraying themes of fantasy and original concepts will dance to the sounds of calypso, soca, reggae and steel pan. ""This reminds me so much of being back home in Trinidad and Tobago,"" said Lystra Hinds, information officer of the Trinidad and Tobago Embassy in Washington. ""I'm temporarily relieved from the nostalgic feeling of not being back home during the carnival season."" Jackie Cumberbatch, a costume designer for more than 40 years who lives in Silver Spring, said: ""I love to mesmerize onlookers with my spectacular designs. 'Mas-Mas,' my presentation for this year, shows elaborate pieces with intricate detail."" (""Mas"" is short for masqueraders and is also the word that Caribbean people often use for carnival.) Math teacher Patrice Francis of Hyattsville, one of the few female costume designers and bandleaders, said, ""It's hard work, but I enjoy every minute of it."" Her presentation, ""A Brazilian Dream,"" depicts the native dance and natural resources of Brazil. ""I've used an array of bright colors, large feathers and costume jewelry,"" she said. The weekend also includes activities for children, performers, Caribbean cuisine, arts, crafts and souvenirs.  The festival is in Benjamin Banneker Park at Barry Place, Saturday and Sunday from noon to 7 p.m. Admission is $10 or free for children under 12 and seniors.

AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY (Saturday through Thursday) Creatures that creep, crawl, slither and even swim are definitely the museum’s stars this season. The popular 2006 exhibition “Lizards & Snakes: Alive!” has reopened, with more than 60 breathing (and hissing) examples, from five continents. The museum is also showing a new Imax film, “Sea Monsters: A Prehistoric Adventure,” playing every half-hour from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Its subject is not the monsters of myth but very real species, like Dolichorhynchops and Styxosaurus, which swam the oceans while T. rex walked the earth. Open daily, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., at Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5200, amnh.org. Tickets to special exhibitions and Imax films (includes museum admission): $22; $16.50 for students and 60+; $13 for 12 and younger. 
‘ARCHAEOLOGY ZONE: DISCOVERING TREASURES FROM PLAYGROUNDS TO PALACES’ (Sunday through Thursday) Children will step into the shoes of an explorer like Indiana Jones in this exhibition at the Jewish Museum, but the adventures will be purely scholarly. Still, there is plenty of excitement in analyzing artifacts like a jar handle, a clay jug and a bangle and figuring out the purpose behind ancient pieces like a Greek helmet and a bull-shaped vessel. This interactive show also includes a recreated room from the Ottoman period (about 1900), where young archaeologists can dress in costume. (Through June 15, 2009.) Sunday through Wednesday, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., and Thursday to 8 p.m., 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. Free with admission: $12; $10 for 65+; $7.50 for students; free for under 12 and members.
THE CHILDREN’S THEATER COMPANY (Saturday and Sunday) In New York you’re never too little for the stage, and this company welcomes actors as young as 7, as well as those much older. Its latest showcase features several short musicals. “The Bread and Butter Battle” and “Yertle & Myrtle , the Tyrant Turtles” are both Dr. Seuss adaptations dealing  in Seussian fashion  with power and its exploitation. “Rescue Me” uses popular song to deal with another aspect of power: how American women acquired it. (Through July 20.) At 4:30 p.m., Bahai Unity Center, 53 East 11th Street, Greenwich Village, childrenstheatercompany.org. Reservations required: (212) 633-6629. $12. 
‘CINDERELLA’ (Saturday) Forget about a wicked stepmother and a pumpkin-turned-coach. This new production by Youth on Target Theater Company presents a version drawn from the Italian tradition, in which Cinderella’s mother is very much alive, and Cinderella is not so much persecuted as immobilized by grief. (Her father has died.) For ages 7 and older, this retelling will run through July 27 in different Brooklyn locations. At 2 p.m., Chez Bushwick, 304 Boerum Street, (212) 352-3101, youthontarget.org; $15; $10 for 12 and under.
CIRCUS SUNDAYS IN JUNE (Sunday) Brooklyn not only has a floating concert hall (Bargemusic), it also has a floating circus. This attraction, on board the Waterfront Museum and Showboat Barge, presents different entertainers every Sunday of the month. This final Sunday’s roster includes the oddball juggler Will Shaw; Dikki Ellis, a tightrope-walking clown; and Kenichi Ebna, a master robo-dancer from Japan. At 1 and 4 p.m., Conover Street and the waterfront, Red Hook, (877) 238-5596, waterfrontmuseum.org. Tickets: in advance, $16; $10 for under 12. At the door, $18 and $12.
CROSS-GENERATION CHESS TOURNAMENT (Sunday) The chessboard is common ground in this program, which brings together children from kindergarten through high school with elderly adults. Players of all levels are invited for games, live classical music (by the violinist Vladimir Tsypin) and, most important, lively conversation. Admission and a kosher lunch are free. From noon to 5 p.m., JCC in Manhattan, seventh floor, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street. Registration (optional): (917) 822-3141, crossgenerationchess.com.
‘DARWIN’S GARDEN: AN EVOLUTIONARY ADVENTURE’ (Friday through Sunday) Long before children study the theory of natural selection in school, they can become acquainted with its principles in this special display, a junior version of the larger Darwin show that recently closed at the New York Botanical Garden. This display, in the Everett Children’s Adventure Garden, allows young visitors to enter a re-creation of Darwin’s laboratory, see a model of the ship used in his travels and emulate his research, including exploring various bogs and creating a herbarium specimen using the primrose. From 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Bronx River Parkway (Exit 7W) and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700, nybg.org. Admission, including the Everett garden and all displays: $13; $11 for students and 62+; $5 for ages 2 to 12; free for under 2. 
 ‘THE GAZILLION BUBBLE SHOW’ (Friday through Sunday, and Wednesday and Thursday) Children love bubbles, and Ana Yang, in this interactive show, promises not just a gazillion but also some of the largest ever blown (her husband, Fan Yang, holds the world record), along with light effects and lasers. Audience members may even find themselves in bubbles of their own. (Through January.) Friday at 2 and 5 p.m.; Saturday at 11 a.m. and 2 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at noon and 3 p.m.; Wednesday at 2 p.m.; Thursday at 2 and 7 p.m., New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, gazillionbubbleshow.com; $41.50 to $86.50.
‘IT’S A BEE, HONEY!’ (Sunday) Children are invited to join the hive in this outdoor production, billed as a “musical puppet circus.” Created by Erin Orr and the performer known as Baby Dee, the show illustrates the life cycle of bees in a humorous combination of nature documentary and sports event. (The drone bees, in their race to the queen, are interviewed by sportscasters.) On Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon Ms. Orr will hold a free puppet workshop at the Abrons Arts Center for children 5 to 10 who would like to play worker bees (parents must also attend); the participants will then rehearse on Sunday at 1:30 p.m. Performance at 3 p.m., rain or shine, the Abrons Arts Center sculpture garden, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 598-0400, abronsartscenter.org; free.
‘MAGIC: THE SCIENCE OF ILLUSION’ (Saturday through Thursday) Harry Potter may rely on a wand and a book of spells, but real performing magicians base their acts on the natural, not the supernatural. This exhibition shows how much they depend on the laws of science, creating several illusions (including mind-reading and levitation) and using video testimony from mavens like Penn & Teller and Doug Henning to explain the physics, psychology and math behind the tricks. (Through Sept. 14.) At the New York Hall of Science, 47-01 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 699-0005, nyscience.org. Hours: Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Monday, 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Tuesday through Thursday, 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free with admission: $11; $8 for ages 2 through 17, students and 62+; free for under 2. Also free this Sunday from 10 to 11 a.m. 
NEW YORK FAMILY ARTS FESTIVAL (Friday through Sunday) This city is made up of many cultures, and this annual event explores several in each of three weekends. The concluding festivities start on Friday at 7 p.m. with “Resurrection of a Swan,” a love story told through music, dance and poetry, including the lyrics of gospel, jazz and opera works. On Saturday from 2 to 6 p.m. families can enjoy an Italian Cultural Village, with workshops devoted to folk dances, the tarantella (a children’s workshop is at 4:10) and commedia dell’arte. On Sunday at 2 p.m. the bandleader Johnny Colón will be interviewed and perform with his orchestra. At the Riverside Theater, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, theriversidetheatre.org. Free, but reservations requested: (212) 870-6784.
‘NETTING CHANGE THROUGH SPOKEN WORD’ (Saturday) Ne Ne Ali is only 10, but she has already developed a talent and a social conscience. A spoken-word artist and rapper, she is the organizer and headliner of this event, which will raise funds for Nothing but Nets (nothingbutnets.net), a campaign to combat malaria in Africa by purchasing mosquito netting for beds. The evening will also include world music by the band the Earthman Experience. At 6 p.m., Middle School 142, 3750 Baychester Avenue, near Schefflin Avenue, Wakefield, the Bronx, (614) 638-9113; free with a donation. 
NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY (Saturday and Sunday) Take your children to the museum to watch TV? It may sound heretical, but here it makes sense: the historical society is screening the complete HBO mini-series “John Adams,” one episode each Sunday through Aug. 3. The first installment was shown last Sunday, but it’s easy to catch up, and families can enter a raffle to win the entire set on DVD. The screenings are being held in conjunction with the exhibition “French Founding Father: Lafayette’s Return to Washington’s America,” as is the society’s “Living History Days” program. Saturday is one of those days, with re-enactors portraying Revolutionary soldiers  the Fourth New York Regiment  visiting, starting at 10 a.m. At 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. Free with admission: $10; $7 for educators and 65+; $6 for students; free for 12 and under and members.
‘PICTURE THIS!’ (Friday and Monday) Children are often adorable in front of the camera, but put them behind it, and they can produce fascinating work. This exhibition displays photography, animation and documentary video by students in elementary, middle and high schools in all five boroughs of New York. The pieces were done during residency programs sponsored by Magic Box Productions, an arts education organization that sends teaching artists into the schools. From 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., the Gallery at 180 Maiden Lane, between Front and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (914) 630-0256, magicboxproductions.org; free. 
‘PRESERVATION DETECTIVES’ FAMILY TOURS (Sunday) The Lower East Side has transformed over the last century, but the past still comes vibrantly alive in many of its corners. One is the Eldridge Street Synagogue, the landmark 1887 building where many Jewish immigrants worshiped. Now the Museum at Eldridge Street, the organization that recently restored the synagogue, is leading a family tour every Sunday. Children 5 to 10 can view artifacts, learn neighborhood and cultural lore and role-play a little history, including making a copy of a stained-glass window and putting together a Yiddish newspaper. At 2 p.m., 12 Eldridge Street, between Canal and Division Streets, (212) 219-0302, eldridgestreet.org; $10; $8 for 65+; $6 for ages 5 through 18.
‘RAINBOW ADVENTURES’ (Saturday) Artists have been chasing rainbows since time immemorial, and children can join them in this workshop at the Rubin Museum of Art. Working with museum educators, young visitors will look through the galleries for works with rainbows, which have special significance in Himalayan culture. Then they will make their own rainbow-inspired creations. From 2 to 3:30 p.m., 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, Ext. 344, rmanyc.org. Registration recommended. Free with museum admission: $10; $7 for students, 65+ and neighbors (ZIP codes 10011 and 10001); free for under 12 and members.
STATE FAIR MEADOWLANDS (Friday through Thursday) This annual event captures the spirit of an old-fashioned state fair only a short drive from the city. This year’s attractions include the Marcan Tiger Show, which uses live animals to educate the public about the plight of Bengal tigers; the Nerveless Nocks, a Swiss group doing aerial acts that are nerve-racking for the audience if not for them; and the Bantu Wizards Acrobatic Troupe, tumblers and dancers from Kenya. (Through July 13.) Friday, 6 p.m. to 2 a.m.; Saturday, 2 p.m. to 2 a.m.; Sunday, 2 p.m. to midnight; Monday through Thursday, 6 p.m. to midnight. At Giants Stadium Fairgrounds, East Rutherford, N.J., (973) 450-1073, njfair.com; $9; $6 for 12 and under; free for children under 34 inches tall.
TENNIS LESSONS (Monday) Aspiring Venus Williamses and Andy Roddicks can get into the swing of things at this free summer-long program, sponsored by the New York Junior Tennis League. Open to children ages 6 through 18, the sessions, held in all five boroughs, include not only tennis instruction but also field trips and tournaments. Tennis equipment is available for loan; parents must register their children onsite. More information and a full list of locations: (347) 417-8157, nyjtl.org.
 ‘THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH’ (Friday and Monday) O.K., so it’s not what you’d call a children’s play. But the setting is undeniably fun and family-friendly  at Castle Clinton in Battery Park  and the actors, the members of New York Classical Theater, change locations with every scene, so the audiences roam the night as much as Macbeth. And perhaps most appealing for budding Shakespeare enthusiasts ages 7 to 13, the theater will offer preperformance workshops in July in which they can learn about the play and act out a scene. Those attending are advised to bring a picnic basket and sneakers. At 7 p.m., Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 252-4531, newyorkclassical.org; free.
WORD FOR WORD KIDS (Saturday) The words come from books and stories, which are celebrated in this summer series at the Bryant Park Reading Room. This Saturday’s installment, “Brazilian Carnival,” will include Ila Lane Gross reading folklore from her book “Animal Tales.” But the fun, for ages 4 through 10, isn’t just about words: children can make their own rain sticks (percussion instruments), learn the Brazilian carnival dance and frolic to a live drummer. From noon to 1 p.m., Bryant Park, Avenue of the Americas at 40th Street, (212) 768-4242, bryantpark.org; free.

Kevin Turner/ The Times-Union SHOE CARNIVAL SIGNS UP FOR SHOE DONATIONS Shoe Carnival, an Evansville, Ind.-based company with two retail locations in Jacksonville, announced  Monday in a release that it will donate lightly used shoes to Soles4Souls, an international shoe charity, and give shoe donors a coupon for $5 toward a shoe purchase at the store. Soles4Souls, dedicated to people worldwide in desperate need, will collect the shoes to give to needy people around the world. Shoe Carnival also will accept $2 donations on behalf of Soles4Souls to give some of the world's 300 million shoeless children their first pair of shoes.  Shoe Carnival has 300 locations nationwide, the release indicated.  Soles4Souls, based in Nashville, Tenn., has distributed more than 3.3 million pairs of shoes to people in more than 60 countries, according to the release.  Jacksonville Jaguars owner Wayne Weaver is Chairman of Shoe Carnival's Board of Directors. The shoe trade-in program and fundraiser runs Sept. 3 through Sept. 24. Kevin Turner/ The Times-Union INBEV TO PAY ANHEUSER CEO BUSCH $10.4 MILLION August Busch IV, chief executive of Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. will be paid nearly $10.4 million after the brewer is sold to InBev SA and $120,000 a month to consult for the new company through the end of 2013. Terms of the consulting deal are being negotiated, according to a filing made Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Busch, a member of the St. Louis-based brewer's founding family, also will be eligible for an additional payment of $13.3 million on various change in control payments and benefits, the filing said.

Associated Press BRAZIL OIL RESERVES MORE THAN INITIALLY THOUGHT A prominent geologist says Brazil's offshore oil reserves could hold as much as 55 billion barrels of crude. Marcio Melo, president of the Brazilian Association of Petroleum Geologists, says studies suggest reserves in the ultra-deep pre-salt layer may contain several times more oil than initially estimated. He says there also could be another 10 billion to 15 billion barrels at other locations along the coast. Melo says the extent of reserves will be clear only after more extensive drilling. Brazil recently announced several new finds off the coast of Rio de Janeiro state. It has estimated they could contain 8 billion barrels of recoverable light crude.

The event will take place from 3 to 11 p.m. at Miramar Regional Park, 16801 Miramar Parkway. The warm-up event is designed to serve as a preview for what people will see at the larger October event, said Keith Winslow, marketing director for North Miami Beach-based Vibez Radio, the event's sponsor. ""All the people in South Florida, whether they're from Trinidad, Guyana, Jamaica ... they can come to Carnival Warm Up and see what Brazil's costumes are going to look like,"" Winslow said. In past years, the event has taken place in Miami and Hialeah, but Winslow said they're now in a long-term deal to run it in Miramar. Winslow believes the new location is ideal because of the many Caribbean natives who make up the population. ""The idea is to make this work this year and make this a permanent location,"" he said. Past events have drawn anywhere from 3,000 to 6,000 attendees. For this year's event, Winslow said they're reaching out more to the Hispanic community, and some of the featured musical guests will include rapper Pitbull and percussionist Tito Puente Jr. Another goal for this year is to present a wider variety of food from the Caribbean. That even means turning away well-known restaurants if they offer the same food as other vendors. ""Our culture is very strong, and we keep these major events to bring out our culture in the park, so people can taste our food and see our ethnic difference when it comes to getting together, dancing,"" said Al Fearon, president and chief operating officer of Vibez Radio. By showing off what Caribbean culture has to offer, Fearon believes that'll help keep it alive in South Florida because many transplants assimilate into their new community once they settle down. ""It's a very big opportunity for us as a cultural organization, as well as for the city of Miramar,"" he said. This season will see the Broward Caribbean Carnival at a new location - Central Broward Regional Park in Lauderhill. The new location offers nicer amenities and will help alleviate parking problems from previous years at Markham Park, said Rafiek Mohammed, Broward Caribbean Carnival's director. In the buildup to October's event, there will also be a children's Carnival at Huizenga Plaza in Fort Lauderdale on Oct. 5. ""It brings all the cultures of the Caribbean together as one people,"" Mohammed said. For Winslow, the complementary events present an opportunity for everyone to see what Caribbean music, food and dance is about in a big venue. ""It's like the Olympics for the Caribbean,"" he said. Admission for Carnival Warm Up is $30, but children under 12 get in free. For information, visit www.carnivalwarmup com. Chris Guanche can be reached at  cguanche@tribune.com.

248,2221528941,,"Breno Mello, the handsome, sculptured leading man in the classic 1959 Brazilian movie “Black Orpheus,” died on July 14 in Porto Alegre, Brazil, his hometown. He was 76.",,"Sep 5, 2008","United States, New York","Blogs, Podcasts, & Websites",News,Brazil New York France,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/2221528941?accountid=4840,Motion picture festivals,General Interest Periodicals--United States,"Breno Mello, the handsome, sculptured leading man in the classic 1959 Brazilian movie “Black Orpheus,” died on July 14 in Porto Alegre, Brazil, his hometown. He was 76.
The death was confirmed on Friday by Priscilla Barroso, a press officer in the Brazilian Embassy in Washington, who said Brazilian newspapers reported that he was found alone in his home. His death was not reported in English-language papers.
Mr. Mello played the title role in what, in Portuguese, is called “Orfeu Negro,” directed by Marcel Camus and based on the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. A trolley-car motorman and gifted guitarist, amid the joyous frenzy of Rio’s carnival, he becomes enthralled with the beautiful, doomed Eurydice, played by Marpessa Dawn. 
Against a backdrop of working-class Rio, with shanties on the hills, the lovers sway in a provocative samba among the crowds. But Eurydice is stalked by a man in a skeleton costume. Eventually, Orfeu finds her in the morgue. In the end, bearing her body in his arms, he falls to his death from a cliff. His guitar, standing in for the lyre of Orpheus, is taken up by one of the street urchins who follow him as a sort of Greek chorus. 
Reviewing the film for The New York Times in 1959, Bosley Crowther called him “a handsome, virile Orpheus who glistens when covered with sweat,” but denigrated his performance. “Black Orpheus” became renowned for its soundtrack by the bossa nova legends Antonio Carlos Jobim and Luiz Bonfá, with songs like “Manhã de Carnaval” and “A Felicidade.” It won the Palme d’Or at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Award and the Golden Globe for best foreign film in 1960. 
Mr. Mello was born in Porto Alegre in 1931. He had played for for Fluminense and Gremio, , major professional soccer teams in Brazil, when Mr. Camus spotted him on a beach and asked him star in “Black Orpheus.” 
Married twice with five children, he later played roles in five less successful films, but returned to soccer because, he said, the Brazilian film industry was not rich enough to support him. He later sold advertising handouts in his home city, he told Agence France-Presse.","Breno Mello, 76, Star of ‘Orpheus,’ Dies",2,2142,breno mello handsome sculptured leading man classic brazilian movie black orpheus died july porto alegre brazil hometown death confirmed friday priscilla barroso press officer brazilian embassy washington said brazilian newspapers reported found alone home death reported englishlanguage papers mr mello played title role portuguese called orfeu negro directed marcel camus based greek myth orpheus eurydice trolleycar motorman gifted guitarist amid joyous frenzy rios carnival becomes enthralled beautiful doomed eurydice played marpessa dawn backdrop workingclass rio shanties hills lovers sway provocative samba among crowds eurydice stalked man skeleton costume eventually orfeu finds morgue end bearing body arms falls death cliff guitar standing lyre orpheus taken one street urchins follow sort greek chorus reviewing film new york times bosley crowther called handsome virile orpheus glistens covered sweat denigrated performance black orpheus became renowned soundtrack bossa nova legends antonio carlos jobim luiz bonfá songs like manhã de carnaval felicidade palme dor cannes film festival academy award golden globe best foreign film mr mello born porto alegre played fluminense gremio major professional soccer teams brazil mr camus spotted beach asked star black orpheus married twice five children later played roles five less successful films returned soccer said brazilian film industry rich enough support later sold advertising handouts home city told agence francepresse,United States,2008,breno mello handsome sculptured leading man classic brazilian movie black orpheus died july porto alegre brazil hometown death confirmed friday priscilla barroso press officer brazilian embassy washington said brazilian newspaper reported found alone home death reported englishlanguage paper mr mello played title role portuguese called orfeu negro directed marcel camus based greek myth orpheus eurydice trolleycar motorman gifted guitarist amid joyous frenzy rio carnival becomes enthralled beautiful doomed eurydice played marpessa dawn backdrop workingclass rio shanty hill lover sway provocative samba among crowd eurydice stalked man skeleton costume eventually orfeu find morgue end bearing body arm fall death cliff guitar standing lyre orpheus taken one street urchin follow sort greek chorus reviewing film new york time bosley crowther called handsome virile orpheus glisten covered sweat denigrated performance black orpheus became renowned soundtrack bossa nova legend antonio carlos jobim luiz bonfá song like manhã de carnaval felicidade palme dor cannes film festival academy award golden globe best foreign film mr mello born porto alegre played fluminense gremio major professional soccer team brazil mr camus spotted beach asked star black orpheus married twice five child later played role five le successful film returned soccer said brazilian film industry rich enough support later sold advertising handout home city told agence francepresse,breno mello handsome leading man classic brazilian movie black orpheus died july porto alegre hometown death confirmed friday barroso press officer brazilian embassy washington brazilian newspaper reported found alone home death reported paper mr mello played title role portuguese called orfeu negro directed marcel camus based greek myth orpheus eurydice motorman gifted guitarist amid joyous frenzy becomes beautiful doomed eurydice played marpessa dawn backdrop workingclass shanty hill lover provocative among crowd eurydice stalked man skeleton costume eventually orfeu find morgue end bearing body arm fall death cliff guitar standing orpheus taken follow sort greek chorus reviewing film york bosley crowther called handsome orpheus covered sweat performance black orpheus became renowned soundtrack bossa nova legend antonio carlos jobim luiz bonfá song like manhã carnaval felicidade palme dor cannes film festival academy award golden globe best foreign film mr mello born porto alegre played major professional soccer team mr camus spotted beach asked star black orpheus married twice five child later played role five le successful film returned soccer brazilian film industry rich enough support later sold advertising home told francepresse

She was 74.
The cause was a heart attack, her daughter Dhyana Kluth said.
Ms. Dawn’s death followed by 41 days that of her “Black Orpheus” co-star, Breno Mello, who played the title role. The family did not publicly announce the death until this week. 
Directed by Marcel Camus and based on the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, “Orfeu Negro,” as it is called in Portuguese, brings together an innocent country girl, played by Ms. Dawn, and a trolley car motorman and gifted guitarist, portrayed by Mr. Mello. They meet amid the frenzy of Rio’s carnival and are soon swaying to a provocative samba among the crowds. But Eurydice is stalked by a man in a skeleton costume. Eventually, Orpheus finds her in the morgue. In the end, bearing her body in his arms, he falls to his death from a cliff. 
 Reviewing the film for The New York Times in 1959, Bosley Crowther wrote that Ms. Dawn conveys “forthright emotion.”
 “A pretty, frank face and a gentle manner that suggest absolute innocence,” the review continued, “gather an aura of wistfulness about her that filters down into a melancholy mood.” 
“Black Orpheus” became renowned for its soundtrack by the bossa nova legends Antonio Carlos Jobim and Luiz Bonfá, with songs like “Manhã de Carnaval” and “A Felicidade.” It won the Palme d’Or at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Award and the Golden Globe for best foreign film in 1960. 
Gypsy Marpessa Dawn Menor was born near Pittsburgh on Jan. 3, 1934. As a teenager, she moved to England, where she had bit parts on television, and later to France, where she worked as a governess and danced and sang in nightclubs.

260,2221201589,,"STANDING in a back exhibition space at James Cohan Gallery in Chelsea, the Brazilian artist Beatriz Milhazes sounded like a rigorous Constructivist as she discussed her four latest paintings, which were propped against the walls.

“This one is based on squares, kind of a grid,” she said, pointing to “Mulatinho,” whose blocks of color are broken up by dots, rippling stripes, paisleylike ornaments, stylized flowers and a piece of carefully painted fruit.
Mr. Cohan, her dealer, who had just walked into the room, started laughing. “You and Mondrian,” he said.
 Although Ms. Milhazes clearly considers herself a geometric abstractionist, those are hardly the first words that spring to mind when regarding her work, the focus of a solo show at the gallery. 
Squares often come laced with lines and dots, circles frequently mutate into eye-popping targets, and everything is laden with motifs that evoke the multilayered culture of her home, Rio de Janeiro. There are arabesques, roses and doily patterns, borrowed from Brazilian Baroque, colonial and folk art; flowers and plants inspired by the city’s botanical garden, which is next door to her studio; and thick wavy stripes  a nod to the undulating Op Art-inspired mosaic pavement that the Brazilian landscape designer Roberto Burle Marx created in 1970 for the promenade at Copacabana Beach. 
Yet Ms. Milhazes, 48, maintains that her compositions are essentially geometric. “Sometimes I put the square behind,” she said, referring to the initial layer of the painting, “and I build up things on top of it. The squares may disappear, but they are still a reference for me to think about composition. And I’ve always been very loyal to my ideas.”
Today her career seems as jampacked as her paintings themselves. In addition to the show at James Cohan, which runs through Nov. 15, her first major career survey is on view at the Pinacoteca do Estado in São Paulo, Brazil. By early November, within a span of a month, three limited-edition projects  a tapestry, a textile design and an artist’s book  will have been issued. She has also just completed a new site-specific window installation for a show at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo. (Sometime next year she will create a similar piece for the Winter Garden at the World Financial Center in New York.) 
Then there is “Gamboa,” a sculptural installation that will be unveiled on Nov. 1 at Prospect.1, the contemporary-art biennial in New Orleans. Ms. Milhazes intends to transform one room of a 19th-century mint building into a shimmering chandelier hung with globes and flowers, all of which have been fabricated by workers at one of the many samba schools in Rio.
“It didn’t make any sense to organize a room with paintings,” Ms. Milhazes said of the project. “New Orleans was always about the vitality, the dancing and the music. So I link it  the carnival in New Orleans with the Carnaval in Rio. It will make this kind of dialogue between two cities.”
Growing up under the former military dictatorship in Brazil, Ms. Milhazes did not have access to the mainstream art world. Although Brazil has had an avant-garde art scene since the 1930s, opportunities for young artists in Rio were limited in the early 1980s, when she embarked on her career. Back then Latin American collectors typically focused on work from past eras. “We didn’t have any voice,” Ms. Milhazes said of her colleagues from that time.
For a young painter who longed to see the work of 20th-century masters like Mondrian and Matisse, the situation was especially arid. “Twenty-five years ago, if you didn’t travel, you never would see paintings,” she said. And today, she noted, painting is still only an undercurrent in Brazil’s art scene. “We have strong contemporary art,” she said, “but more in conceptualism and installation. So I am quite isolated here.”
But isolation also helped Ms. Milhazes develop her rather unusual working process. “You don’t have the history on your back,” she explained. She starts by painting with acrylic on sheets of plastic, working motif by motif, creating each image in reverse as if she were making a print. 
Once a motif is dry she glues the painted side to the canvas, almost as if it were a decal, and then peels off the plastic to reveal a surface that looks handmade but is nearly unmarked by brushstrokes. Then she continues layering as if she were making a collage. When she developed this method in the late ’80s, she said, “it opened a huge door for me.”
The door opened further in 1992, when the Brazilian curator and critic Paulo Herkenhoff brought three Americans to Ms. Milhazes’s studio: Richard Armstrong, then a curator at the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh and now the incoming director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in New York; Madeleine Grynsztejn, then a curator at the Art Institute of Chicago and now director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago; and Fred Henry, president of the Bohen Foundation, a nonprofit group that commissions new works of art. 
Mr. Henry soon became a devoted collector, and Mr. Armstrong eventually invited Ms. Milhazes to participate in the 1995 Carnegie International. “That was the opening,” she said. Through the Carnegie, she met a New York dealer, Edward Thorp, who began showing her work in SoHo the next year. Her career quickly became multinational. Now she frequently shows in Europe, especially London, as well as in Latin America, Asia and New York.
Ms. Grynsztejn said Ms. Milhazes’s widespread appeal lies in the fact that she is a “glocal” artist  someone whose work is grounded in the international language of modernism while also firmly rooted in her own place and time. “What I really loved about the work,” she said, “was the way that it merged figuration and abstraction, and even decoration and craft, within the highly intellectual enterprise of formal abstraction.” 
She was also fascinated by the strong echoes of local culture in Ms. Milhazes’s work. After leaving the studio, she recalled, “I remember very vividly that when we sat down to lunch, the plastic tablecloth that covered the restaurant tables had the same bright, busy patterns” as Ms. Milhazes’s paintings. Later that day she experienced another jolt of déjà vu while passing the ornamental facade of a Baroque church. At that point, she said, “I understood that that vernacular had infiltrated at a very high level into Beatriz’s work.”
Yet despite the Brazilian feel of her work, there is nothing else quite like it in Brazilian art, past or present, said Adriano Pedrosa, a curator in São Paulo who has known Ms. Milhazes for years. “She seems to have a quite close relationship with Brazilian art history,” he said, “but that’s because she’s appropriating things.” 
He also sees her oeuvre as being related to Antropofagia, a Brazilian movement of the ’20s and ’30s whose name means cannibalism. Mr. Pedrosa described it as “this concept where the Brazilian native artist appropriates foreign elements and digests them to produce something personal and unique.” 
In fact Ms. Milhazes often says her major influence is Tarsila, a Brazilian painter who came out of that movement, as well as Mondrian and Matisse.
“In the beginning,” she said, “I felt a connection between Spanish Latin American and Brazilian, which is more Portuguese: the Baroque churches, the costumes, the ruffles, things that have volume or a sculptural shape.” 
But ultimately, she said, although she wanted to incorporate all those things into her work, “I wanted to put them together based on a geometric composition. Because at the end of the day, I was only interested in structure and order.”","Modern Motifs, With Echoes of Brazil",2,7655,standing back exhibition space james cohan gallery chelsea brazilian artist

Today her career seems as jampacked as her paintings themselves. In addition to the show at James Cohan, which runs through Nov. 15, her first major career survey is on view at the Pinacoteca do Estado in São Paulo, Brazil. By early November, within a span of a month, three limited-edition projects — a tapestry, a textile design and an artist's book — will have been issued. She has also just completed a new site-specific window installation for a show at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo. (Sometime next year she will create a similar piece for the Winter Garden at the World Financial Center in New York.)
Then there is ""Gamboa,"" a sculptural installation that will be unveiled on Nov. 1 at Prospect.1, the contemporary-art biennial in New Orleans. Milhazes intends to transform one room of a 19th-century mint building into a shimmering chandelier hung with globes and flowers, all of which have been fabricated by workers at one of the many samba schools in Rio.
""It didn't make any sense to organize a room with paintings,"" Milhazes said of the project. ""New Orleans was always about the vitality, the dancing and the music. So I link it — the carnival in New Orleans with the Carnaval in Rio. It will make this kind of dialogue between two cities.""

            ","The Ledger; Lakeland, Fla.","Oct 30, 2008","United States, Lakeland, Fla.",Newspapers,News,,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/390223928?accountid=4840,,General Interest Periodicals--United States,"MAITLAND | In this country, the revelry, excitement and lavishness of celebrating Mardi Grass in New Orleans is well-known and enjoyed by massive crowds. But it's not the only festival that takes on a splashy carnival-like atmosphere.


In Puerto Rico, Carnival Ponceno (Ponce Carnival) is celebrated in the town of Ponce in the south part of the island before the beginning of Lent, and coincides with the Mardi Grass carnival in New Orleans and the Carnival of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. Carnival Ponceno has its own unique traditions, and one is the use of Mascaras, or the carnival masks that participants wear that illustrate a rich Puerto Rican folkloric tradition.


Those often extravagantly designed masks have been on display at the Maitland Art Center, part of an exhibit that celebrated not just the Puerto Rican carnivals, but also the artwork of a growing number of Puerto Rican artists now living in Central Florida. Several, in fact, contributed artwork to the art center for this exhibit.


'All of the masks are used during the carnival, which is on the same date as the carnival in New Orleans,' said Ana Bartolomei, director of exhibitions for the Maitland Art Center. 'This is a tradition that has been going on in Puerto Rico for hundreds of years.'


Known as 'vejigantes' -- or Puerto Rican devil -- masks, they have a very long tradition indeed. As the exhibit's program book noted, 'The origin of the Puerto Rican carnival and mask-making traditions is traced back to the XVII Century with the participation of vejigantes in public celebrations in the city of San Juan. Through history, the vejigantes and their masks evolved and became an integral part of Puerto Rican culture and national pride.'


In addition to wearing the mascaras, the carnival's participants 'used stilts and have long robes,' Bartolomei said. They would walk through the streets, scaring people with their vejigas -- an inflated dried cow bladder.


'The whole carnival has a series of events,' she said. 'It lasts a whole week.'


In 1999, the Maitland Art Center bought a vejigantes mascara created by Lilly Carrasquillo, who lives now in Orlando. The mask had been exhibited at Orlando City Hall. It eventually inspired the art center to create an entire exhibit around the flamboyant mascaras.


'We said one day, 'Hey, why don't we have an exhibition,"" Bartolomei said. 'I started with contacting different artists and collectors.'


Several agreed to contribute their hand-made mascaras, including Freddy Soto, who provided a papier-mache and ceramic mold mascaras that incorporates the Puerto Rican flag, plus ten horns sticking out of the head. Juan (Johnny) Soto, Freddy's brother, contributed a dragon-like mascaras, complete with its own horns.


'These masks can be used, but are really more for exhibition,' Bartolomei said.


Several others were on loan to the art center by Juan Alindato Garcia, 82, who is not the only member of the family to create mascaras and represents a grand tradition for these artists: passing on the skill to younger members of the family.


'This is a family thing,' Bartolomei said. 'They teach their sons and their sons teach the grandchildren and the nephews and so on.'


Alexis Torres Quintana provided a mascaras that resembles a fish, demonstrating how diverse the styles of each mascaras can be.


While researching mascaras creators, 'In Orlando I discovered two artists,' Bartolomei said. 'They are art teachers and also make masks.'


One was Carrasquillo, whom Bartolomei asked to 'make a mask for the exhibit, which she did.' Carrasquillo's daughter-in-law, Wendy Martinez -- who also lives in Orlando -- also contributed one.


'She paints everything with such precision and care,' Bartolomei said. 'It's a fascinating thing to watch being done.'


Paintings shown as part of the exhibit were contributed by several artists, including Pedro J. Brull, who was born in Puerto Rico and now lives in Central Florida, including his piece 'La Muerte Del Vejigantes,' which puts the legend of the mascaras to canvas.


The mascaras and paintings shown during the exhibit primarily reflected the artwork of three communities in Puerto Rico: Loiza, Ponce and Hatillo.


The Maitland Art Center, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is at 231 W. Packwood Ave. in downtown Maitland and is open daily.

After years of benign economic conditions, the four horsemen of financial apocalypse - credit crunch, recession, volatility and uncertainty - are blazing a trail across the horizon.  Executives must now reassess their organisation's agenda and communicate it clearly. If history is a guide, most will frame the current conditions as a threat and take action to protect what they have. Mitigating threats in tough markets is prudent, but companies that adopt a defensive position ignore a counter-intuitive truth: the worst of times for an economy as a whole can be the best of times for individual companies to create value.  Over the past decade I have studied dozens of companies that created value in some of the world's most challenging countries, such as Brazil and China; in some of the toughest industries, including airlines and steel; and amid currency crises and recessions. In setting their agenda for hard times, business leaders would do well to follow their lead. The golden opportunity There are occasions when a company can create value significantly in excess of the cost of the resources required to seize an opportunity, whether by acquisition, innovative product launches, expanding in new markets or buying resources.  Golden opportunities do not come along every day, and most people think they are more likely to arise when the good times are rolling. In fact, the moment when you can transform your fortunes often emerges during the toughest times. Turbulence creates a buyers' market for acquisitions. Ted Arison bought Carnival Cruise Lines in 1974, in the depths of the recession sparked by the first oil shock, while Lakshmi Mittal made his first big acquisition during a downturn in the steel industry. Sometimes companies can acquire customers more easily in tough times, as ING Direct did by picking up the deposits of two Icelandic banks.  Companies can also use difficult trading conditions to drive a hard bargain on tangible assets. Emirates purchased Airbus A380s on favourable terms one month after the September 11 attacks, at a time when many airlines were reluctant or unable to make large commitments.  Executives can exploit uncertainty to extend their position in growing markets. During the early 1990s, the volatility of former Soviet markets frightened many multinationals, which made small bets or none at all. Mars, in contrast, sold its Mars and Snickers bars through a network of small distributors, advertised aggressively and built the largest foreign-owned factory at the time. It quickly rose to be a leader in the Russian market in chocolate and pet food. When other multinationals panicked and pulled out of the country during the rouble crisis of 1998, Mars held its nerve.  To spot such opportunities, leaders should ask: what opportunities does the current turmoil create? What could we do today that positions us well for tomorrow? Should we double down in growth markets rather than retrenching to our core? Accelerate change In periods of relative stability, business leaders attempt fundamental improvements to the organisation by, for example, shifting from selling products to solutions, fostering collaboration across silos or cultivating a more entrepreneurial culture.  Such changes are hard to make at the best of times. In a downturn managers may despair that conditions will derail any progress they have made. Yet difficult conditions also open a window of opportunity.  A crisis marks a clean break with the past and creates an external rationale to make unpopular but necessary changes. In a downturn, investors and boards are more forgiving of short-term earnings dips that might result from actions to improve the organisation in the long term.  Kun-Hee Lee, Samsung's chairman, for example, welcomed the currency crisis that roiled Asian markets in the late 1990s. A decade earlier, Mr Lee had initiated a set of changes to transform Samsung from a competent Korean player to a global leader. By the mid-1990s early wins had sapped the drive to make hard changes. Mr Lee harnessed the energy unleashed by the external crisis to reinvigorate the internal changes. Questions to ponder: what changes would I want to make even if this crisis had never occurred? How can I harness the crisis to pull those changes forward? Instil cost discipline Many companies alternate between growth binges and periods of sober cost cutting. The better approach is to maintain cost discipline throughout the economic cycle.  Starting with a single ship, Carnival Cruise Lines survived the recessions of the 1970s by focusing on efficiency. In contrast to competitors, Carnival maintained this discipline, earning a 5-10 per cent advantage in operating costs as a percentage of revenues over the following decades. Cumulatively, these cost savings provided a war chest to acquire rivals, build new ships and overtake Royal Caribbean as the undisputed industry leader. In many companies, budgets begin with last year's expenditures as a baseline; costs then rise incrementally. Facing a deep recession in Brazil, retailer Lojas Americanas introduced zero-based budgeting to ""reset the clock"" each year. The measure required managers to develop their budget from scratch and justify each budget item anew. When considering cost cuts, managers should ask themselves how the process will help to maintain cost discipline in the future.  The worst of times can be the best of times to create value for leaders alert enough to spot opportunities and courageous enough to seize them.

When other multinationals panicked and pulled out of the country during the rouble crisis of 1998, Mars held its nerve.   To spot such opportunities, leaders should ask: what opportunities does the current turmoil create? What could we do today that positions us well for tomorrow? Should we double down in growth markets rather than retrenching to our core?   Accelerate change   In periods of relative stability, business leaders attempt fundamental improvements to the organisation by, for example, shifting from selling products to solutions, fostering collaboration across silos or cultivating a more entrepreneurial culture.   Such changes are hard to make at the best of times. In a downturn managers may despair that conditions will derail any progress they have made. Yet difficult conditions also open a window of opportunity.   A crisis marks a clean break with the past and creates an external rationale to make unpopular but necessary changes. In a downturn, investors and boards are more forgiving of short-term earnings dips that might result from actions to improve the organisation in the long term.   Kun-Hee Lee, Samsung's chairman, for example, welcomed the currency crisis that roiled Asian markets in the late 1990s. A decade earlier, Mr Lee had initiated a set of changes to transform Samsung from a competent Korean player to a global leader. By the mid-1990s early wins had sapped the drive to make hard changes. Mr Lee harnessed the energy unleashed by the external crisis to reinvigorate the internal changes.   Questions to ponder: what changes would I want to make even if this crisis had never occurred? How can I harness the crisis to pull those changes forward?   Instil cost discipline   Many companies alternate between growth binges and periods of sober cost cutting. The better approach is to maintain cost discipline throughout the economic cycle.   Starting with a single ship, Carnival Cruise Lines survived the recessions of the 1970s by focusing on efficiency. In contrast to competitors, Carnival maintained this discipline, earning a 5-10 per cent advantage in operating costs as a percentage of revenues over the following decades. Cumulatively, these cost savings provided a war chest to acquire rivals, build new ships and overtake Royal Caribbean as the undisputed industry leader.   In many companies, budgets begin with last year's expenditures as a baseline; costs then rise incrementally. Facing a deep recession in Brazil, retailer Lojas Americanas introduced zero-based budgeting to ""reset the clock"" each year. The measure required managers to develop their budget from scratch and justify each budget item anew. When considering cost cuts, managers should ask themselves how the process will help to maintain cost discipline in the future.   The worst of times can be the best of times to create value for leaders alert enough to spot opportunities and courageous enough to seize them.

""This is the ultimate fantasy trip,"" said Richard Zaher, chief executive of Paramount Business Jets.Zaher said Paramount plans on balancing the emissions created by the Boeing Business Jet through TerraPass, a leading carbon management services company.  TerraPass commends the move by Paramount. ""TerraPass is pleased to have been chosen as the carbon offset provider for this amazing journey,"" said Erik Blachford, CEO of TerraPass Inc. and former CEO of Expedia.""This trip has everything,"" Zaher said. ""We wanted do something to protect the environment, but it is also be extremely fun and educational."" In a unique collaboration, the internationally acclaimed author and leadership expert Dr. Thomas D. Zweifel, the CEO of Swiss Consulting Group and former Columbia University professor who has worked with Fortune 500 senior managers and heads of state, is on board to give keynotes and workshops on 21st century leadership challenges, executive communication, and effective cross-cultural management. ""We are fortunate to have Zweifel with us on the trip,"" Zaher, said. ""He has been described by the U.S. State Department as a 'miracle worker.' He adds for our clients the one-of-a-kind value that you simply don't get anywhere else.""Passengers have the options to work with Dr. Zweifel in one-on-one executive coaching sessions, map out their future and upgrade their leadership game.To add to the trip, Paramount has booked world-renowned spiritual mentor, facilitator, author and nationally syndicated columnist Janice Lundy.Lundy presents ""Believe, Breathe and Be Well: Spiritual Health for Busy People."" The discussion centers on total wellbeing, workplace success and harmonious relationships with others using a mixture of the world's traditional wisdoms.On-board entertainment includes award-winning composer and classical pianist Wayne Sharpe, known worldwide for his blend of Eastern instrumentation and strong Western styles. The trip is open to anyone who wishes to book it, whether they are individuals, couples, an entire family wishing for an unforgettable reunion-vacation, or executives who wish to treat their officers to a remarkable team-building opportunity.The endeavor costs $356,250 per passenger for a grand total of approximately $5.7 million.For those who cannot take a vacation for an entire month, Paramount has added an option to book the final three legs of the tour, to make a 16-day adventure for $4.2 million.Between the exciting opportunities aboard the Boeing Business Jet come the stops and the magnificence of the world's wonders.During travel on one of the most lavish vessels the private jet industry has to offer, a guide prepares passengers for what to expect at each coming stop. The most knowledgeable and resourceful tour guides available meet travelers at each destination to fully reveal the mystique of all stops on the trip.Furthermore, fully trained security details accompany travelers at the destinations, and all people on the trip are issued cell phones to ensure the highest level of safety for their utmost worry-free enjoyment.While in each city, the members of the voyage stay at the highest-quality resorts and are chauffeured to each wonder by premium ground transport. Each stop on the journey includes extra time for travelers to experience the best of the best in entertainment, shopping, other tourist attractions and parties, specially created for the travel party. Taking off from JFK airport Wednesday, Jan. 26, 2009, the journey stops first in Rome, Italy to showcase the birthplace of modern society, art and science. While there, travelers can witness the magnificence of the Roman Coliseum. Estimated to have been built around 72 AD, the Coliseum was capable of holding up to 80,000 spectators who witnessed everything from public spectacles to bloody gladiator clashes. Aside from the Coliseum, Rome offers the awesome architecture and reverence of Vatican City with the breathtaking art of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel painting, as well as some of history's most notable artistic works and buildings. Rome also hosts some of Europe's premier tourist and nightlife destinations. From Rome, passengers continue to Cairo, Egypt to visit the pyramids of Giza. Considered a wonder since the ancient times, the pyramids continue to baffle and capture the imaginations of those ranging from visitors to religious pilgrims and scientists. According to History.com, the pyramid, Khufu, in Giza remained the world's tallest building for more than 4,000 years and was not surpassed until the 19th century.Next Stop: Amman, Jordan from which the voyagers take luxury transport to the ancient ruins of Petra, carved and built into the sides of sandstone cliffs and canyons containing large networks of passages and gorges. While on horseback, visitors are able to witness the majestic architecture of a city that has been inhabited since prehistoric times and has served as temples and tombs to its inhabitants. Located between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea, Petra has served as critical crossroads between Arabia, Egypt and Syria-Phoenicia since ancient times.After Petra, it's on to exotic Agra, India, where the spectacular Taj Mahal graces the landscape. A gigantic mausoleum erected between 1631 and 1648 at the behest of the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan, in honor of his favorite wife, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) calls the Taj Mahal ""the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage."" Next, Paramount Business Jets Seven Wonders participants go to Beijing, China to see the awe-inspiring Great Wall of China. The stop only scratches the surface of the more than 4,000-mile long series of structures, known as the Great Wall, that has stood since the fifth or sixth century BC and is visible from outer space. Visitors can, too, experience the mystery of the Forbidden City, located in the heart of Beijing. Beijing is also a bastion of Asian life, culture, entertainment and fare. From Asia, this fortunate band of executive jet charter travelers heads to the Land Down Under stopping in Cairns, Queensland, Australia. By boat, the sightseers travel to the Great Barrier Reef where they may enjoy by snorkel or simply from the boat the 400 types of coral, 1,500 kinds of fish and 4,000 species of mollusk that inhabit the reef. The reef is also home to the endangered sea cow and large green sea turtle, according to UNESCO. Cairns offers one-of-a-kind shops, restaurants and other unique activities.After a few days in Cairns, it's back to the Western Hemisphere by way of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Feb. 21, to experience one of the most breathtaking displays of modern spirituality, the Christ the Redeemer statue atop Corcovado Mountain in Tijuca Forest National Park, nearly half a mile above the city. The reinforced concrete and soapstone statue was completed in 1931 after half a decade of construction. It stands 130 feet high and its outstretched arms measure 92 feet from fingertip to fingertip. It is visible for 20 miles and weighs approximately 2 million pounds.And, as Paramount Seven Wonders travelers enjoy the Catholic landmark, they can also experience the Brazilian pre-lent celebration known as Carnival. Perhaps the largest, most exuberant and outlandish celebration in the world, Carnival makes New Orleans' Mardi Gras look like a child's birthday party. It is a collage of world-class entertainment, celebrations of life and good-spirited decadence.On February 26, the trip ends where it started, on a luxurious flight back to JFK airport in New York.""This may be the most memorable, extravagant and exotic trip ever offered by a private jet charter company,"" Zaher said. To book a spot on Paramount Business Jets' Seven Wonders of the World vacation today, elite travelers should call 877-727-2538. Those interested should remember that this opportunity is available to only 16 people on a first-come, first-serve basis.

","South Florida Sun - Sentinel; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.","Jan 1, 2018","United States, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.",Newspapers,News,,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/1982812132?accountid=4840,Parades; Artistic directors; Religion; Corruption; Gays & lesbians,General Interest Periodicals--United States,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil - As political polarization intensifies in the United States, Latin America's largest nation is locked in its own escalating culture wars, with the rise of an increasingly powerful religious right. 
The mayor of this sultry metropolis slashed funding for Carnival, its gay pride parade and a procession honoring an Afro-Brazilian goddess. Mayor Marcelo Crivella, a Pentecostal Christian, calls the moves fiscal prudence. But Rio's libertines see a thinly veiled crusade to impose God's law from city hall. 
Evangelical politicians such as Crivella - a 60-year old bishop and former gospel singer who once claimed homosexuality could result from botched abortions - are finding enormous success in Brazil. Their rise comes as conservative Protestant faiths make massive inroads in this predominantly Catholic country and as corruption scandals taint traditional parties, causing more Brazilians to vote outside the box. 
Under former presidents Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff, Brazil stood as a symbol of the global left. But religious conservatives have turned the tables here in part by forming pragmatic coalitions. They have allied with agribusiness interests and gun lobbies, forming a ""BBB bloc"" of bullets, bulls and Bibles.
Evangelical politicians persuaded embattled President Michel Temer, who needed their support to survive in office, to remove progressive passages about gender identity and sexual orientation from textbooks that were to be distributed in schools.
""This is Rio!"" said Marcelo Misailidis, artistic director for Beija Flor, one of the samba schools, or community groups, that puts on Rio's annual Carnival celebration. ""But this mayor, these people - they would put clothes on a cow if they could.""
That a religious conservative was elected mayor a year ago in a city known for ribald revelry is not as far-fetched as it sounds. Sexual freedom thrives in Rio's South Zone neighborhoods such as Copacabana and Ipanema, where picturesque beaches serve up a cornucopia of flesh. But the city's vast and relatively poorer north is more conservative and religious. 
Previously a national senator from Rio, Crivella emerged victorious after a highly fractured mayor's race, in which some of his opponents faced corruption allegations. He successfully portrayed himself as the nontraditional candidate that frustrated Cariocas - as the residents of this city are called - were looking for. 
Crivella is the nephew of Edir Macedo, a well-known televangelist and chairman of Rede Record, Brazil's second-largest television network. Macedo built a multibillion-dollar empire promoting ""prosperity theology"" - or wealth through the cleansing power of worship. At the same time, he became a perennial target of corruption probes. 
Crivella in the past has taken positions well outside the mainstream. In a 2002 book written after years spent as a missionary, he denounced the priests of Afro-Brazilian faiths - which have millions of followers here - as ""sorcerers and witches."" He also argued that public health care systems could save money by embracing the practice of faith healing.
Crivella declined to be interviewed for this story.
""It's as if he's made an effort not to appear in public, to be a ghost mayor,"" said João Feres, a political-science professor at Rio State University. ""But what little he is doing seems to be colored by this conservative agenda.""
The mayor's church warns against the pageant of glitter and flesh that is Carnival, citing the consumption of alcohol and drugs as well as the ""promotion of sexuality and cheating."" But it raised eyebrows when Crivella in February became the first mayor in recent memory to skip the festivities during his first year in the job. 
A few months later, he cut city funding to Carnival nearly in half, from $7.4 million to $4 million, citing hard economic times and the need to shift spending to schools. Carnival officials are planning a smaller, shorter event for 2018.
""This isn't about budgets,"" said Misailidis, the artistic director. ""This is about intolerance."" 
In a written statement, Crivella's press office said the mayor believes that ""Christian principles and values form the base of Western civilization. Among them is the rejection of hatred, of discrimination and of prejudice, and respect for free will.""
Crivella's administration completely defunded the city's 2017 gay pride celebration, which had received the equivalent of $114,000 from the city last year. In response, organizers put on the event in November with the aid of private sponsors Uber and Ambev, the country's largest beer producer, and renamed it ""the parade of resistance.""

Rio Carnival is making its way to Sam Houston State University for the first time through the work of multiple student organizations.
Brought to campus by Bailamos Latin Dance, Spanish Conversation Club, and Multi Cultural Student Services, Rio carnival originated from Rio de Janeiro and is celebrated throughout most Catholic countries. Rio Carnival is the largest carnival in the world, bringing Brazil approximately half a million foreign tourists each year.
Although it is celebrated for five days beginning Friday the 13th and ending on Fat Tuesday as an ode to glitter and all bodily pleasures, SHSU’s celebration will be condensed into one wild night of drool inducing food, live entertainment, and cultural experiences.
Bailamos club dancers will be spreading awareness of Latin culture by performing in costume to the music of a live band in various styles of Spanish dance with an emphasis on the rhythmical Brazilian dance, the samba.
The carnival hopes to bring students and faculty together for a night of cultural celebration and awareness. Students can partake in free food, give-aways, masks and face painting.
“I think it will give a great name not only to the Latin community, but just Bailamos in general and it will be a safe haven for people to come out to and just have fun,” Bailamos and Spanish Conversation club president Kerrie Hall said.
Bailamos is a Latin dance organization at SHSU that teaches the community about Latin and Afro Latin culture through dance. The organization was created three semesters ago, however Rio Carnival is the club’s first self-headed event, funded by the Campus Life Development Fund and Multi Cultural Student Services, along with donations from family and friends.
“We just want everyone to come out, enjoy some free food, some good performances, have a good time, and meet new people you haven’t met before,” Hall said.
Rio Carnival will be held tomorrow in the LSC Ballroom from 7 to 10 p.m.

323,1988131082,"Los Angeles Times (Online) , Los Angeles: Tribune Interactive, LLC. Jan 16, 2018.",Antonio Sabato Jr. is best known as a soap opera star and Calvin Klein underwear model. But parts of his acting career are raising eyebrows among some conservatives as the Republican and early supporter of President Trump runs for Congress in California.,Los Angeles Times (Online); Los Angeles,"Jan 16, 2018","United States, Los Angeles","Blogs, Podcasts, & Websites",News,,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/1988131082?accountid=4840,Presidents; Testosterone; Careers; Motion pictures; Actors; Pornography & obscenity; Bodybuilding,General Interest Periodicals--United States,"Antonio Sabato Jr. is best known as a soap opera star and Calvin Klein underwear model. But parts of his acting career are raising eyebrows among some conservatives as the Republican and early supporter of President Trump runs for Congress in California.
Some Republicans in his district, which includes most of Ventura County and has been represented by Rep. Julia Brownley (D-Westlake Village) since 2013, are saying movie roles in which Sabato simulated sex with a man and appeared nude disqualify him from representing the GOP.
Ret. Air Force Maj. Jeffrey Burum, another Republican in the race, deemed the movies “pornography” and called on Sabato to end his campaign.
“His behavior is inconsistent with anything I would want from a congressional leader. It’s also inconsistent with a party which has always favored traditional family values, which do not include porn,” Burum said.
Sabato and his campaign disputed the description of his work as pornographic.
Charles Moran, a Sabato advisor and the former president of California Log Cabin Republicans, said that while Ventura County may be more conservative than neighboring Los Angeles County, many people in the entertainment industry live there and are unlikely to care about Sabato’s previous roles.
“They know what it takes to be a successful actor in the industry, and anybody trying to make Antonio Sabato Jr.’s career and job choices salacious does so without really knowing the value of the craft,” he said, predicting the controversy would have no impact on the race. “For a long time, gays have played straight, straights have played gay. A good actor can do this, and many do. Antonio Sabato Jr. is no different.”
Sabato noted the movies “Testosterone” and “Deadly Skies,” which were both filmed more than 10 years ago, are part of a three-decade-long acting career.
“I’ve done many movies. I’ve done things I’m proud of and things I’m not so proud of, that’s just the way any actor works,” he said. “They don’t know what kind of congressman I’ll be, the work ethic I have.”
Actor Antonio Sabato Jr. to run for Congress against Rep. Julia Brownley »
Sabato, 45, is best known for roles on “General Hospital” and “Melrose Place” in the 1990s, and “The Bold and the Beautiful” from 2005 to 2006. He has appeared in many other scripted television shows and movies, music videos and reality programs.
As first reported on the Ventura County website Citizens Journal, Sabato’s critics are protesting his roles in two films where he plays a gay man.
In 2003’s “Testosterone,” Sabato plays an Argentine man who mysteriously deserts his writer boyfriend. He appears fully nude in the film.
Three years later, Sabato played an Air Force officer who was dismissed under the military policy of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell in “Deadly Skies.” The film, about an asteroid on a collision course with Earth, contains a scene where Sabato appears partly nude and simulates having sex with another man.
Unlike films that would traditionally be considered pornography, the movies starred mainstream Hollywood actors, including Jennifer Coolidge, Michael Moriarty, David Sutcliffe, Rae Dawn Chong and Sonia Braga, and don’t comprise solely sexual content. “Testosterone” premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was reviewed by the New York Times, which described it as “a shaky comic noir larded with soft-core sex.”
Sabato is running for Congress in the 26th District. Brownley narrowly won reelection in 2014, but then overwhelmingly won in 2016. A Brownley spokesman declined comment on the matter. The area used to be closely split between Republicans and Democrats, but has grown more liberal in recent years, with Hillary Clinton winning 58% of the district’s votes in 2016 to Trump’s 36%.
Sabato is a vocal supporter of Trump and spoke on his behalf at the Republican National Convention in 2016, efforts that he said have hampered his acting career.
“I was blacklisted from Hollywood,” Sabato said, adding he had no regret for supporting Trump and has been to the White House since the election.
“I’m proud of our president. Look at everything he has been able to do in such a short amount of time,” he said.
Critics also note that Sabato posed for Playgirl magazine. He appeared on the cover and inside a 1993 issue devoted to “Soap Studs.” He did not appear nude and was covered with strategically placed bubbles.
Sabato isn’t the first political candidate who has posed nude or acted out sex scenes.

Republican Scott Brown was elected to the Massachusetts Legislature and the U.S. Senate many years after he posed nude, shielding himself with his arm for Cosmopolitan magazine’s “America’s Sexiest Man” contest in 1982.
Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger acted in many love scenes and appeared partly nude during his long acting career. He briefly appeared fully nude onscreen — blurry and shot from a distance — in the first installment of the “Terminator” franchise. He was regularly seen wearing little clothing during his bodybuilding career. And during the 2003 campaign, a two-decade-old Playboy video emerged that included footage of Schwarzenegger dancing provocatively with scantily clad women at Carnival in Brazil.
Rob Stutzman, a former top adviser to Schwarzenegger, said none of these appearances mattered to voters, who were familiar with the candidate as an actor and a bodybuilder. But, he said, the same cannot be said about Sabato.
“With Antonio Sabato Jr., very few people know who he is, you’re still in the first-impression stage with what voters know about you. Whereas with Arnold, no one was surprised he once danced with Carnival girls wearing dental floss in Rio,” he said. “The type of nudity ... in a movie like ‘Terminator’ isn’t all that far removed from him standing in bikini bottoms in the Metropolitan Museum of New York as a piece of living art.”
But some Republican voters noted that the movies took place many years ago.
“There are some people that are concerned about it, but my thinking is go back to biblical times: May the first person who has never sinned cast the first stone,” said Kerry Nelson, a small-business owner and the immediate past president of the Conejo Valley Republican Women Federated. “It was so many years ago, and it was his movie career, not his lifestyle.”

Some Republicans in his district, which includes most of Ventura County and has been represented by Rep. Julia Brownley (D-Westlake Village) since 2013, are saying movie roles in which Sabato simulated sex with a man and appeared nude disqualify him from representing the GOP.
Retired Air Force Maj. Jeffrey Burum, another Republican in the race, deemed the movies ""pornography"" and called on Sabato to end his campaign.

""His behavior is inconsistent with anything I would want from a congressional leader. It's also inconsistent with a party which has always favored traditional family values, which do not include porn,"" Burum said.
Sabato and his campaign disputed the description of his work as pornographic.
Charles Moran, a Sabato advisor and the former president of California Log Cabin Republicans, said that while Ventura County may be more conservative than neighboring Los Angeles County, many people in the entertainment industry live there and are unlikely to care about Sabato's previous roles.
""They know what it takes to be a successful actor in the industry, and anybody trying to make Antonio Sabato Jr.'s career and job choices salacious does so without really knowing the value of the craft,"" he said, predicting the controversy would have no effect on the race. ""For a long time, gays have played straight, straights have played gay. A good actor can do this, and many do. Antonio Sabato Jr. is no different.""
Sabato noted the movies ""Testosterone"" and ""Deadly Skies,"" which were both filmed more than 10 years ago, are part of a three-decade-long acting career.
""I've done many movies. I've done things I'm proud of and things I'm not so proud of, that's just the way any actor works,"" he said. ""They don't know what kind of congressman I'll be, the work ethic I have.""
Sabato, 45, is best known for roles on ""General Hospital"" and ""Melrose Place"" in the 1990s, and ""The Bold and the Beautiful"" from 2005 to 2006. He has appeared in many other scripted television shows and movies, music videos and reality programs.
As first reported on the Ventura County website Citizens Journal, Sabato's critics are protesting his roles in two films in which he plays a gay man.
In 2003's ""Testosterone,"" Sabato plays an Argentine man who mysteriously deserts his writer boyfriend. He appears fully nude in the film.
Three years later, Sabato played an Air Force officer who was dismissed under the military policy of Don't Ask, Don't Tell in ""Deadly Skies."" The film, about an asteroid on a collision course with Earth, contains a scene in which Sabato appears partly nude and simulates having sex with another man.
Unlike traditional pornographic films, the movies starred mainstream Hollywood actors, including Jennifer Coolidge, Michael Moriarty, David Sutcliffe, Rae Dawn Chong and Sonia Braga, and don't comprise solely sexual content. ""Testosterone"" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was reviewed by the New York Times, which described it as ""a shaky comic noir larded with soft-core sex.""
Sabato is running for Congress in the 26th District. Brownley narrowly won reelection in 2014, but then overwhelmingly won in 2016. A Brownley spokesman declined to comment on the matter. The area used to be closely split between Republicans and Democrats, but has grown more liberal in recent years, with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton winning 58% of the district's votes in 2016 to Trump's 36%.
Sabato is a vocal supporter of Trump and spoke on his behalf at the Republican National Convention in 2016, efforts that he said have hampered his acting career.
""I was blacklisted from Hollywood,"" Sabato said, adding he had no regret for supporting Trump and has been to the White House since the election.
""I'm proud of our president. Look at everything he has been able to do in such a short amount of time,"" he said.
Critics also note that Sabato posed for Playgirl magazine. He appeared on the cover and inside a 1993 issue devoted to ""Soap Studs."" He did not appear nude and was covered with strategically placed bubbles.
Sabato isn't the first political candidate who has posed nude or acted out sex scenes.
Republican Scott Brown was elected to the Massachusetts Legislature and the U.S. Senate many years after he posed nude, shielding himself with his arm for Cosmopolitan magazine's ""America's Sexiest Man"" contest in 1982.
Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger acted in many love scenes and appeared partly nude during his long acting career. He briefly appeared fully nude onscreen -- blurry and shot from a distance -- in the first installment of the ""Terminator"" franchise. He was regularly seen wearing little clothing during his bodybuilding career. And during the 2003 campaign, a two-decade-old Playboy video emerged that included footage of Schwarzenegger dancing provocatively with scantily clad women at Carnival in Brazil.
Rob Stutzman, a former top adviser to Schwarzenegger, said none of these appearances mattered to voters, who were familiar with the candidate as an actor and a bodybuilder. But, he said, the same cannot be said about Sabato.
""With Antonio Sabato Jr., very few people know who he is, you're still in the first-impression stage with what voters know about you. Whereas with Arnold, no one was surprised he once danced with Carnival girls wearing dental floss in Rio,"" he said. ""The type of nudity ... in a movie like 'Terminator' isn't all that far removed from him standing in bikini bottoms in the Metropolitan Museum of New York as a piece of living art.""
But some Republican voters noted that the movies took place many years ago.
""There are some people that are concerned about it, but my thinking is go back to biblical times: May the first person who has never sinned cast the first stone,"" said Kerry Nelson, a small-business owner and the immediate past president of the Conejo Valley Republican Women Federated. ""It was so many years ago, and it was his movie career, not his lifestyle.""

",New York Times (Online); New York,"Jan 30, 2018","United States, New York","Blogs, Podcasts, & Websites",News,Brazil,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/1992410370?accountid=4840,Bands; Men; Feminism; Traditions; Women; Reggae; Power; Gender; Musical performances,General Interest Periodicals--United States,"SALVADOR, Brazil — This northeastern Brazilian city is famous for its Afro-Brazilian drumming traditions; the internationally acclaimed bloco-afro band Olodum has broadcast its colorful drums and pounding syncopation internationally for decades through music collaborations including Michael Jackson’s “They Don’t Really Care About Us” and Paul Simon’s “The Obvious Child” . To see that band — which is composed almost exclusively of men — or any of the city’s other renowned bloco-afros, like Ilê Aiyê, perform live in the streets of Salvador is a deep dive into the roots of this country’s musical traditions.
But traditions change. Or actually, traditions are changed. By women like the ones that make up Banda Didá, a group composed exclusively of black women, pounding out those same Afro-Brazilian rhythms, filling up Salvador’s night with its old sounds, played by new hands.
Banda Didá is a unique musical group breaking gender boundaries in the capital of Bahia, the state that is the epicenter of Brazil’s African cultural infusion. “Until Didá, no one here played like us,” said one of the band’s leaders and longest-serving members, Viviam Caroline de Jesus Queirós.
Formed in 1993, the band was believed to be the first all-female bloco-afro in Brazil. “We’ve brought visibility to a group — black women — that have been historically marginalized here,” Ms. Queirós said. “We’ve feminized percussion here.”
Though they’ve been around for years, Didá’s popularity today is representative of an atmosphere of female empowerment in Brazil. Didá, once a torchbearing group among dozens of all-male bloco-afros, now shares the streets of Salvador with a few other all-female groups. As Brazil’s power structure has turned more conservative in recent years, with many female politicians being replaced by male lawmakers who have pushed for legislation to limit women’s access to abortion, the country’s feminist movement has gained strength.

Banda Didá earned its visibility by taking on old social norms that pushed women away from drums. Historically, “drumming in Salvador has been considered a man’s role,” said Jeff Packman, a University of Toronto associate professor who specializes in the study of drum culture in Salvador. He and Ms. Queirós both report that the gender norms around drumming came out of particular beliefs about a woman’s role and place. One theory, the big bass drums are too heavy for women. The women could even get hurt, and then who would have the babies? Another theory suggested that playing drums in the streets in the night — especially during the bacchanalia of Carnival season, when drum groups perform most intensely — is too time-consuming and dangerous for women, who should instead stay home.
Good luck convincing the women of Banda Didá of those theories today.
On a recent weekend evening, a few dozen of the group’s 85 members gathered in the second floor of their headquarters. Women, some with children in their laps, listened attentively to the guest speakers, which included older local black women sharing their experiences of finding strength in their feminism and their blackness. “It is our responsibility to share with the world the power that is within us as black women,” one speaker told the group.
Two nights later, the band was busy rehearsing its Carnival performance; the celebration is just weeks away. During the captivating rehearsals, which take place in the street in front of their headquarters, the women not only play bass drums — called surdos — strapped around their shoulders or waists and resting against knees protected by thick kneepads, but also swing the heavy, keg-sized drums up into the air, balancing them above their heads with one trembling arm, as the seconds tick by and the gathered crowd cheers, in an act symbolizing their defiance of those old gender rules.
Adriana Portela, the first female conductor of a bloco-afro in Salvador’s history, attributes the debunking of the myths around female drumming to “the power of the uterus.” She said this just before rehearsal, while pulling on kneepads and helping the group’s young singer with new lyrics. Jean Jesus dos Santos, one of the younger members of the group — part of the next generation of Didá — was one room over and painting blush onto her cheeks.
“They used to say drumming wasn’t for women because the instrument was heavy,” said Jean. “But we’re warrior women, and yes, we can play. And the proof of that is there in the street: we play just as well as the men.”
An hour later, after their rehearsal and backstage at an Olodum show a block away, Olodum’s vice president, Marcelo Gentil, said he can’t disagree. “They are from Bahia, so they drank from the same source as Neguinho,” he said, referring to the man who is regarded as the founder of the samba-reggae rhythm that drives much of the drumming in Salvador. “And they play that rhythm a lot better than men who aren’t from Bahia.”
Neguinho do Samba, a former leader of Olodum, founded Banda Didá in 1993. Neguinho died several years ago, but his daughter, Debora de Souza, remains an integral part of the administration of Banda Didá. While counting out registration forms in a yellow folder labeled “Carnaval,” Ms. de Souza recalled the passion that led her father to form Banda Didá. ""My dad was a feminist. He cared about women, and while he was with Olodum he saw that there was a need for there to be a female drum group.”
According to Ms. de Souza, Paul Simon felt so grateful to Olodum for helping him earn a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year in 1992, that he helped him acquire the three-story colonial mansion where Banda Didá in now based. Neguinho’s vision was long-term: to form an all-female drum group, but also ensure the perpetuity of the group by offering free instrument-making workshops and music lessons for women and children at the house.
Despite the financial uncertainty that troubles most Brazilian cultural groups that receive little government support, the Didá project has been a success. Today, 130 women and girls take drum lessons at Didá — still for free — creating a diverse pool of candidates for inclusion in the band. The group finances itself through private events and donations. Mornings at the Didá house are filled with the muted sounds of private tutoring in tambourine or conga drums behind closed doors. In the afternoon, young girls scamper down the central stairway after their drum lessons, and on a recent afternoon, older women waited in line to register to volunteer during the group’s Carnival performance.
The uniqueness of the city’s first all-female group, and the luxury of the group having a physical headquarters, means that Didá’s reputation now precedes it. The group used to go out to the poor neighborhoods around Salvador to recruit talented young drummers; now, on a typical day, a steady stream of young women show up at the house to inquire about drum lessons or joining the group.
""This is the place where I found myself,” said Maiana Santos Bonfim, another young member of the band. “It's where I learned to accept myself, my hair, my body, my race. And I just love playing drums.”
Ms. Queirós was just 16 years old when she started playing drums with Banda Didá. She is now 34 and pursuing a Ph.D. in samba-reggae ethnomusicology in her free time away from the group. “I feel like I became a woman through this group,” she said with steady conviction, between sips of passionfruit juice at a local Afro-Brazilian cafe.
""In my opinion, the drum could be the great technology for women this century. It redefines the body of a woman — especially black women,” said Ms. Queirós. “I think it’s a weapon; it’s a tool. It gives us power, and makes us more beautiful. And it makes it so that our message is heard farther and farther away.”

 Rio state Health Secretary Luiz Antonio Teixeira Junior said on Tuesday that there have been no recent urban cases of the disease and that the risk of contagion in touristic parts of Rio is ""nearly zero.""
 ""Visit our beaches, but avoid forests, bushes and waterfalls. That is where the mosquitoes that transmit the disease live,"" Teixeira Junior said in a press conference.
 Brazil is vaccinating more than 20 million people against yellow fever in a massive campaign to control a budding outbreak, and the secretary said Rio state alone has vaccinated more than 8 million. The World Health Organization also suggests that visitors to Rio get vaccinated.
 As of Tuesday, Brazil's Health Ministry has confirmed 213 cases across the country and 81 deaths in the current outbreak. That's fewer than the 468 cases and 147 deaths that had been confirmed during the same period in the last outbreak, which was unusually large.
 Alfredo Lopes, the head of Rio's hotel association, said tourism agencies have expressed concern about the outbreak.
 ""There are many doubts because of yellow fever, but few cancelations for now. We don't know how many people would come, but later chose not to,"" Lopes said.
 Rio state Tourism Secretary Nilo Felix said the disease won't have a meaningful impact during the high season for tourists. He expects 1.5 million visitors in the city in the next couple of weeks, about the same figure of 2017.
 James Story, the U.S. consul general in Rio, said he hasn't heard of American concerns about yellow fever directly and believes the outbreak will not affect tourism in the coming weeks.
 ""Carnival is an international festival with people from all over. I am sure this time will be no different,"" he said. - VOA",Brazil: Rio Urges Carnival Visitors to Stick to Urban Areas,2,1961,brazilian health authorities urging carnival visitors stick celebrations city rio de janeiro avoid heading town sightseeing waterfalls forests yellow fever detected rio state health secretary luiz antonio teixeira junior said tuesday recent urban cases disease risk contagion touristic parts rio nearly zero visit beaches avoid forests bushes waterfalls mosquitoes transmit disease live teixeira junior said press conference brazil vaccinating million people yellow fever massive campaign control budding outbreak secretary said rio state alone vaccinated million world health organization also suggests visitors rio get vaccinated tuesday brazils health ministry confirmed cases across country deaths current outbreak thats fewer cases deaths confirmed period last outbreak unusually large alfredo lopes head rios hotel association said tourism agencies expressed concern outbreak many doubts yellow fever cancelations dont know many people would come later chose lopes said rio state tourism secretary nilo felix said disease wont meaningful impact high season tourists expects million visitors city next couple weeks figure james story us consul general rio said hasnt heard american concerns yellow fever directly believes outbreak affect tourism coming weeks carnival international festival people sure time different said voa,Thailand,2018,brazilian health authority urging carnival visitor stick celebration city rio de janeiro avoid heading town sightseeing waterfall forest yellow fever detected rio state health secretary luiz antonio teixeira junior said tuesday recent urban case disease risk contagion touristic part rio nearly zero visit beach avoid forest bush waterfall mosquito transmit disease live teixeira junior said press conference brazil vaccinating million people yellow fever massive campaign control budding outbreak secretary said rio state alone vaccinated million world health organization also suggests visitor rio get vaccinated tuesday brazil health ministry confirmed case across country death current outbreak thats fewer case death confirmed period last outbreak unusually large alfredo lope head rio hotel association said tourism agency expressed concern outbreak many doubt yellow fever cancelations dont know many people would come later chose lope said rio state tourism secretary nilo felix said disease wont meaningful impact high season tourist expects million visitor city next couple week figure james story u consul general rio said hasnt heard american concern yellow fever directly belief outbreak affect tourism coming week carnival international festival people sure time different said voa,brazilian health authority visitor stick celebration janeiro avoid town sightseeing waterfall forest yellow fever health secretary luiz antonio teixeira junior tuesday recent urban case disease risk part nearly zero visit beach avoid forest bush waterfall mosquito disease live teixeira junior press conference million yellow fever massive campaign control budding outbreak secretary alone vaccinated million health organization suggests visitor get vaccinated tuesday health ministry confirmed case across country death current outbreak thats fewer case death confirmed period last outbreak unusually large lope head hotel association tourism agency expressed concern outbreak many doubt yellow fever dont know many would come later chose lope tourism secretary felix disease wont impact high season tourist expects million visitor next couple week figure james story u general hasnt heard american concern yellow fever directly belief outbreak affect tourism coming week international festival sure different voa

Tillerson visits Colombia
Rex Tillerson, US secretary of state, is due to arrive in Colombia as part of a tour of Latin America that has included stops in Mexico, Argentina and Peru. Washington said ahead of the visit that Venezuela, which is suffering a severe economic crisis, would be high on the agenda for discussion. In a speech before setting off Mr Tillerson said that China was now the largest trading partner of Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Peru. He said Russia’s growing presence in the region was “alarming as well”, adding that strong institutions and accountable governments were needed to secure sovereignty against “potential predatory actors”. Mr Tillerson travels to Jamaica on Wednesday.

Ryanair
Ryanair reports third-quarter earnings. The low-cost carrier has just reached its first union deal, agreeing to recognise Britain’s pilot group as it attempts to resolve a long-running battle with cockpit crews over wages and conditions. Michael O’Leary, chief executive, had earlier said hell would freeze over before he would welcome unions into Ryanair, but the company now says dialogue with organised workers will help the business. The airline reported earnings per share of $4.34 for the last quarter in October, missing the consensus estimate of $4.37. The consensus EPS forecast for the third quarter is $0.50. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $0.41.

Africa mining conference
Cape Town hosts the Investing in African Mining Indaba. The conference is expected to draw thousands of investors and key corporate figures, including delegations from 45 African and non-African governments. The mining sector is enjoying its best run since 2010 as a combination of accelerating global growth and supply constraints has driven raw material prices to their highest level in more than three years, boosting the profitability and cash positions of the world’s biggest mining houses. However, some in the industry may be wary of mining’s history of violent boom and bust cycles. The conference will also present a platform for Zimbabwe’s new administration to attract investment. President Emmerson Mnangagwa has been keen to stress the country is now “open for business”. The event runs until Thursday.

EU expansion
The European Parliament meets for a plenary session in Strasbourg, where the EU will hold out the prospect of membership to six western Balkan countries by 2025 as it seeks to breathe new life into enlargement of the bloc, strengthen controls on migration and counter Russian influence in the volatile region. There will be a debate with the prime minister of Croatia, Andrej Plenkovic, on the future of Europe and also a European Commission statement on the decision adopted on the EU Enlargement Strategy on the Western Balkans.
* EU to map out membership for 6 western Balkan states
BP
BP posts fourth-quarter results. BP reported underlying third-quarter profits on a replacement cost basis - the measure watched most closely by analysts - of $1.87bn, compared with $933m in the same period last year. BP said early last month that while the lowering of the US corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 per cent would have a positive impact on future earnings, the reforms would have a negative impact on its fourth-quarter results. BP is expected to see a strong rise in profits from its upstream business but its refining margin is likely to fall.
* BP says US tax reforms will cause $1.5bn hit
General Motors
General Motors is expected to report strong year-end results. Chuck Stevens, GM’s chief financial officer, said last month during a 2018 guidance presentation that he expected the US carmaker to “deliver record earnings per share at the high end of the $6 to $6.50 range, which is an increase from our prior guidance”. However, the company warned its earnings would stall this year due to a deteriorating US market. Investors will also watch for commentary on production and inventory levels in a declining US new vehicle sales market and for more information on sales of higher-margin pick-up trucks, SUVs and crossovers.
* US car groups issue warnings over outlook in 2018
Walt Disney
Walt Disney is expected to post a rise in first-quarter revenue, helped by the success of Thor: Ragnarok and Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Disney’s ESPN, which has been losing subscribers, is still trying to boost advertising sales. Disney is in the process of buying most of Fox for $52bn and investors will watch for more details on the deal. They will also seek more clarity on the timing of the launch of the company’s video streaming offerings.
* Disney-Fox deal heralds a new dawn in tax-related M&A
Singapore Air show
Asia’s largest air show opens in Singapore. The Asia-Pacific region is the world’s fastest-growing aviation market and manufacturers will be looking to sell products and services. Strong airline profits and higher defence spending have boosted the outlook for aerospace groups but after a surge of activity in 2017 the event is expected to produce few big-ticket deals. China is pushing into the military drone markets and is also seeking to carve out space in the tightly controlled commercial market with its narrow-body C919. Russia’s Irkut MC-21 and Japan’s Mitsubishi Regional Jet are seeking to become serious competitors and will also be represented.

Rio Tinto
Rio Tinto reports full-year results. Aided by higher commodity prices and a productivity push the Anglo-Australian miner is tipped by analysts to pay a record dividend of $2.75 a share and top up its share buyback programme. For the 12 months to December, Rio is expected to report underlying earnings of $8.58bn, up from $5.1bn in 2016, according to analyst estimates compiled by Vuma, on sales of $41.5bn. Rio’s plans for its 40 per cent interest in Grasberg, the world’s second-biggest copper mine, will also be scrutinised. The miner has held discussions with the government of Indonesia over selling its interest.

GSK
GlaxoSmithKline posts fourth-quarter results. New treatments for HIV and respiratory problems helped boost sales at the UK’s largest drugmaker in the third quarter, which said in October it was on track to meet expectations after being forced to cut the top end of guidance earlier in 2017. This time around GSK is expected to beat forecasts thanks to strong pharmaceuticals and vaccines sales, while cost savings from restructuring and continued efficiencies are likely to boost operating profits.
* GSK leads drugmakers’ fight against superbugs
Tesla
Elon Musk’s Tesla reports fourth-quarter results. The company is expected to post a jump in revenue as it benefits from higher sales of its Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles. However, the electric carmaker will continue to post losses as production efforts for its mass market Model 3 ramp up and the company burns cash. Investors will watch for details about vehicle deliveries as well as guidance for Model S, X and 3 delivery targets in the first quarter and beyond.

BoE policy decision
The Bank of England delivers its interest rate decision. With wage growth still weak and the pace of activity slow by global and historical standards, the Monetary Policy Committee is expected to vote unanimously in favour of leaving rates on hold at 0.5 per cent and asset purchases unchanged. According to Reuters polls, markets see a 50 per cent chance that there will be another move in May, a relatively quick follow-up to November’s rate rise, the first for a decade. The February Inflation Report will also be scrutinised for any signs of rate rises on the horizon. Looking ahead, there has been an upside surprise on growth since November, which could lift the 2018 forecast from 1.6 per cent to 1.7 per cent. Sterling has strengthened and the oil futures curve is sloping downwards, leading HSBC Global Research to think inflation forecasts for 2019 and 2020 could be marked down.

AIG
American International Group reports fourth-quarter earnings. Brian Duperreault, chief executive, pledged to rethink the insurer’s approach to risk taking after he described AIG’s performance as too “volatile” in the wake of last quarter’s wider-than-forecast $1.7bn loss. There will be much to digest this time around. Special items related to a new US law stand to reduce the tax benefits AIG has been able to reap due to the hefty losses it posted during the 2007-09 financial crisis. It also recently reworked its business lines and acquired reinsurer Validus. Analysts will also watch how Mr Duperreault is reshaping AIG into a more technology-focused insurer that is trying to expand underlying businesses after nearly a decade of restructuring and asset sales.

Twitter
Twitter, which has not posted a profit since its debut, is expected to report a gain for the first time in the fourth quarter as efforts to cut costs pay off. Revenue is expected to fall again, raising some concerns, but investors will watch for userbase growth. Chief operating officer Anthony Noto left the company in January and any signs on how his role will be filled will also be watched.
* Anthony Noto leaves Twitter for top job at SoFi
Viacom
Media conglomerate Viacom, which is exploring a merger with CBS, is expected to report a fall in quarterly revenue led by lower income from cable and satellite companies. With more users switching to online entertainment, cable and satellite companies have shed more than 1m subscribers, meaning investors and analysts will pay close attention to commentary on forecasts.

Winter Olympics
The 23rd Olympic Winter Games start at Pyeongchang, South Korea, with doping in the spotlight. The International Olympic Committee has issued invitations to 169 Russian athletes who can compete as neutrals despite being banned in December after alleged state-sponsored doping at the 2014 games in Sochi. There will be seven sports - biathlon, bobsleigh, curling, ice hockey, luge, skating and skiing - including 15 varied disciplines, with 102 medals up for grabs. Nigeria’s women’s bobsleigh team will be the first African sled to compete at the Winter Games and Jamaica is sending a women’s bobsleigh team 30 years after their men’s team made a historic appearance in Calgary. North and South Korea, meanwhile, are still discussing the possibility of a combined women’s ice hockey team.

Rio de Janeiro Carnival
The annual Rio de Janeiro Carnival takes place in Brazil. The opening ceremony sees the mayor handing over the keys to the city to a Dionysian character called King Momo, the Lord of Unruliness, thus heralding four days of revelry and colour. The carnival’s highlight is the samba, with two classes that parade on the Avenida Rio Branco and at the Sambodrome. Some samba schools have members running into thousands, with as many as 30 floats each and divisions of drummers running into the hundreds. Among the confetti, floats, skimpy sequinned costumes and masquerades, the boundaries of race, gender, sex and class are transcended and the masses party.

To see that band -- which is composed almost exclusively of men -- or any of the city's other renowned bloco-afros, like Ilê Aiyê, perform live in the streets of Salvador is a deep dive into the roots of this country's musical traditions.But traditions change. Or actually, traditions are changed. By women like the ones that make up Banda Didá, a group composed exclusively of black women, pounding out those same Afro-Brazilian rhythms, filling up Salvador's night with its old sounds, played by new hands.
Banda Didá is a unique musical group breaking gender boundaries in the capital of Bahia, the state that is the epicenter of Brazil's African cultural infusion. ""Until Didá, no one here played like us,"" said one of the band's leaders and longest-serving members, Viviam Caroline de Jesus Queirós.
Formed in 1993, the band was believed to be the first all-female bloco-afro in Brazil. ""We've brought visibility to a group -- black women -- that have been historically marginalized here,"" Ms. Queirós said. ""We've feminized percussion here.""
Though they've been around for years, Didá's popularity today is representative of an atmosphere of female empowerment in Brazil. Didá, once a torchbearing group among dozens of all-male bloco-afros, now shares the streets of Salvador with a few other all-female groups. As Brazil's power structure has turned more conservative in recent years, with many female politicians being replaced by male lawmakers who have pushed for legislation to limit women's access to abortion, the country's feminist movement has gained strength.

Banda Didá earned its visibility by taking on old social norms that pushed women away from drums. Historically, ""drumming in Salvador has been considered a man's role,"" said Jeff Packman, a University of Toronto associate professor who specializes in the study of drum culture in Salvador. He and Ms. Queirós both report that the gender norms around drumming came out of particular beliefs about a woman's role and place. One theory, the big bass drums are too heavy for women. The women could even get hurt, and then who would have the babies? Another theory suggested that playing drums in the streets in the night -- especially during the bacchanalia of Carnival season, when drum groups perform most intensely -- is too time-consuming and dangerous for women, who should instead stay home.
Good luck convincing the women of Banda Didá of those theories today.
On a recent weekend evening, a few dozen of the group's 85 members gathered in the second floor of their headquarters. Women, some with children in their laps, listened attentively to the guest speakers, which included older local black women sharing their experiences of finding strength in their feminism and their blackness. ""It is our responsibility to share with the world the power that is within us as black women,"" one speaker told the group.
Two nights later, the band was busy rehearsing its Carnival performance; the celebration is just weeks away. During the captivating rehearsals, which take place in the street in front of their headquarters, the women not only play bass drums -- called surdos -- strapped around their shoulders or waists and resting against knees protected by thick kneepads, but also swing the heavy, keg-sized drums up into the air, balancing them above their heads with one trembling arm, as the seconds tick by and the gathered crowd cheers, in an act symbolizing their defiance of those old gender rules.
Adriana Portela, the first female conductor of a bloco-afro in Salvador's history, attributes the debunking of the myths around female drumming to ""the power of the uterus."" She said this just before rehearsal, while pulling on kneepads and helping the group's young singer with new lyrics. Jean Jesus dos Santos, one of the younger members of the group -- part of the next generation of Didá -- was one room over and painting blush onto her cheeks.
""They used to say drumming wasn't for women because the instrument was heavy,"" said Jean. ""But we're warrior women, and yes, we can play. And the proof of that is there in the street: we play just as well as the men.""
An hour later, after their rehearsal and backstage at an Olodum show a block away, Olodum's vice president, Marcelo Gentil, said he can't disagree. ""They are from Bahia, so they drank from the same source as Neguinho,"" he said, referring to the man who is regarded as the founder of the samba-reggae rhythm that drives much of the drumming in Salvador. ""And they play that rhythm a lot better than men who aren't from Bahia.""
Neguinho do Samba, a former leader of Olodum, founded Banda Didá in 1993. Neguinho died several years ago, but his daughter, Debora de Souza, remains an integral part of the administration of Banda Didá. While counting out registration forms in a yellow folder labeled ""Carnaval,"" Ms. de Souza recalled the passion that led her father to form Banda Didá. ""My dad was a feminist. He cared about women, and while he was with Olodum he saw that there was a need for there to be a female drum group.""
According to Ms. de Souza, Paul Simon felt so grateful to Olodum for helping him earn a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year in 1992, that he helped him acquire the three-story colonial mansion where Banda Didá in now based. Neguinho's vision was long-term: to form an all-female drum group, but also ensure the perpetuity of the group by offering free instrument-making workshops and music lessons for women and children at the house.
Despite the financial uncertainty that troubles most Brazilian cultural groups that receive little government support, the Didá project has been a success. Today, 130 women and girls take drum lessons at Didá -- still for free -- creating a diverse pool of candidates for inclusion in the band. The group finances itself through private events and donations. Mornings at the Didá house are filled with the muted sounds of private tutoring in tambourine or conga drums behind closed doors. In the afternoon, young girls scamper down the central stairway after their drum lessons, and on a recent afternoon, older women waited in line to register to volunteer during the group's Carnival performance.
The uniqueness of the city's first all-female group, and the luxury of the group having a physical headquarters, means that Didá's reputation now precedes it. The group used to go out to the poor neighborhoods around Salvador to recruit talented young drummers; now, on a typical day, a steady stream of young women show up at the house to inquire about drum lessons or joining the group.
""This is the place where I found myself,"" said Maiana Santos Bonfim, another young member of the band. ""It's where I learned to accept myself, my hair, my body, my race. And I just love playing drums.""
Ms. Queirós was just 16 years old when she started playing drums with Banda Didá. She is now 34 and pursuing a Ph.D. in samba-reggae ethnomusicology in her free time away from the group. ""I feel like I became a woman through this group,"" she said with steady conviction, between sips of passionfruit juice at a local Afro-Brazilian cafe.
""In my opinion, the drum could be the great technology for women this century. It redefines the body of a woman -- especially black women,"" said Ms. Queirós. ""I think it's a weapon; it's a tool. It gives us power, and makes us more beautiful. And it makes it so that our message is heard farther and farther away.""

 Today, after 16 years, four plastic surgeries and a long process of self-discovery, Wagner, now Kamilla, will become the first transgender woman to be one of the star dancers leading the top-tier Acadêmicos do Salgueiro samba group during Rio's glittering Carnival parades, which begin Sunday.
 While Brazil has a reputation as a free-for-all and tolerant nation, the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community faces significant numbers of hate crimes and killings. In 2017, over 170 transgender people were slain in Brazil, compared with 56 in Mexico and 25 in the United States, according to Transgender Europe, an advocacy group.
 ""Adversity for trans people is everywhere,"" Carvalho said. ""If you go into a bakery with me, people are going to look. If I go to a nightclub that is not used to people like me, everything that is different is going to generate resistance.""
 Born in the Rio favela of Providencia, Carvalho always loved Carnival. After debuting with a small neighborhood group at age 14, she began parading on floats with the Salgueiro samba group in 2008.
 Her big break came last year, when she met the head of Salgueiro, Regina Celi, who invited her to parade in a prominent position.
 Ten years after dancing with Salgueiro for the first time, Carvalho will play a queen as part of this year's Women of the World's Womb theme, which celebrates the strength of black women.
 ""The story is about ... women warriors ... those who made it possible for women to be empowered today. I think the story is perfect for me,"" Carvalho said.
 Celi said Carvalho's prominent role this year was good for Salgueiro, which will compete against 12 other groups for the coveted title of Rio's Carnival champions, a hotly contested event that tens of millions of Brazilians watch live on TV.
 ""It is only natural for us to have this beautiful transgender woman representing us,"" Celi said.
 Despite the danger transgender people face in Brazil, Kamilla sees Carnival as an opportunity to promote tolerance.
 ""People should use the street carnival to enjoy themselves peacefully ... without segregating any kind of person, any race, to embrace people,"" she said. - VOA",Brazil: Transgender Parade Star Opens Doors to Diversity in Rio Carnival,6,2329,paraded carnival age first time rio de janeiro samba group wagner carvalho recognize mirror today years four plastic surgeries long process selfdiscovery wagner kamilla become first transgender woman one star dancers leading toptier acadêmicos salgueiro samba group rios glittering carnival parades begin sunday brazil reputation freeforall tolerant nation lesbian gay bisexual transgender community faces significant numbers hate crimes killings transgender people slain brazil compared mexico united states according transgender europe advocacy group adversity trans people everywhere carvalho said go bakery people going look go nightclub used people like everything different going generate resistance born rio favela providencia carvalho always loved carnival debuting small neighborhood group age began parading floats salgueiro samba group big break came last year met head salgueiro regina celi invited parade prominent position ten years dancing salgueiro first time carvalho play queen part years women worlds womb theme celebrates strength black women story women warriors made possible women empowered today think story perfect carvalho said celi said carvalhos prominent role year good salgueiro compete groups coveted title rios carnival champions hotly contested event tens millions brazilians watch live tv natural us beautiful transgender woman representing us celi said despite danger transgender people face brazil kamilla sees carnival opportunity promote tolerance people use street carnival enjoy peacefully without segregating kind person race embrace people said voa,Thailand,2018,paraded carnival age first time rio de janeiro samba group wagner carvalho recognize mirror today year four plastic surgery long process selfdiscovery wagner kamilla become first transgender woman one star dancer leading toptier acadêmicos salgueiro samba group rio glittering carnival parade begin sunday brazil reputation freeforall tolerant nation lesbian gay bisexual transgender community face significant number hate crime killing transgender people slain brazil compared mexico united state according transgender europe advocacy group adversity trans people everywhere carvalho said go bakery people going look go nightclub used people like everything different going generate resistance born rio favela providencia carvalho always loved carnival debuting small neighborhood group age began parading float salgueiro samba group big break came last year met head salgueiro regina celi invited parade prominent position ten year dancing salgueiro first time carvalho play queen part year woman world womb theme celebrates strength black woman story woman warrior made possible woman empowered today think story perfect carvalho said celi said carvalhos prominent role year good salgueiro compete group coveted title rio carnival champion hotly contested event ten million brazilian watch live tv natural u beautiful transgender woman representing u celi said despite danger transgender people face brazil kamilla see carnival opportunity promote tolerance people use street carnival enjoy peacefully without segregating kind person race embrace people said voa,paraded age first janeiro group wagner carvalho recognize mirror today four plastic surgery long process wagner kamilla become first transgender star dancer leading toptier salgueiro group glittering parade begin reputation nation gay bisexual transgender community face significant number hate crime killing transgender compared mexico united according transgender europe advocacy group everywhere carvalho go bakery going look go nightclub used like everything different going generate resistance born favela carvalho always loved debuting small neighborhood group age began parading float salgueiro group big break came last met head salgueiro celi invited parade prominent position ten dancing salgueiro first carvalho play queen part womb theme celebrates strength black story warrior made possible today think story perfect carvalho celi prominent role good salgueiro compete group title champion event ten million brazilian watch live tv natural u beautiful transgender representing u celi despite danger transgender face kamilla see opportunity promote use enjoy without kind person race embrace voa

[Charleston, W.V]08 Feb 2018: A.7.","RIO DE JANEIRO - Ana Lobo, who is six months pregnant, was at a pre-Carnival street party last weekend when a man started yelling and calling her names.","Charleston Gazette - Mail; Charleston, W.V.","Feb 8, 2018","United States, Charleston, W.V.",Newspapers,News,Brazil United States--US Rio de Janeiro Brazil Southern Hemisphere Latin America,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/1999297013?accountid=4840,Feminism; Women; Assaults; Military police,General Interest Periodicals--United States,"RIO DE JANEIRO - Ana Lobo, who is six months pregnant, was at a pre-Carnival street party last weekend when a man started yelling and calling her names.
""Whore! she remembered him saying, apparently because she was wearing a revealing top.
""Some men have this feeling that they can do whatever to your body, said Lobo, a 29-year-old artist who later that night attended one of the many feminist-themed parties. ""It's time for women to take advantage of this moment to push back.
Many women in Latin America's largest nation are doing exactly that during this year's Carnival celebrations, with block parties of all-female musicians, shirts, necklaces and crowns with messages like ""my breasts, my rules and several campaigns to report and crackdown on harassment.
The #metoo movement against harassment that is roiling the U.S. has yet to catch on in Brazil, which has one of the world's highest homicide rates for women, according to the Brazilian nonprofit Mapa da Violencia.
But while women's groups say that Brazil has a long way to go to address inequality and ingrained machismo, they see glimmers of a potentially bigger movement in the public dialogue about harassment during Carnival and what authorities and several organizations are doing to crack down on it.
The massive party officially begins Friday and goes through Wednesday, but in some cities, such as Rio de Janeiro, it's a multi-week event. The hundreds of block parties often include heavy drinking and round-the-clock samba dancing and they come during the Southern Hemisphere's sweaty summer month of February, when the heat drives many to wear few clothes.
Debora Thome, who in 2015 co-organized a block party called ""Mulheres Rodadas, or ""Women Who Get Around, says Carnival is a good time to focus on fighting harassment because it forces the question of respect amid scantily dressed partygoers.
""A woman can be naked in the street and nobody should be allowed to touch her, said Thome, a former reporter currently working on a doctorate on female participation in Brazilian politics.
Mulheres Rodadas began as a reaction to photo that went viral on Facebook of a man holding a sign in Portuguese saying he ""didn't deserve a woman who gets around.
Thome and co-founder Renata Rodrigues announced plans for a block party protest as a joke, and within 24 hours more than 1,000 women said would attend. They knew they had struck a nerve.
""Carnival is just a small piece of a much larger problem, said Rodrigues.
Since then, several other feminist-themed street party groups have been formed in cities nationwide.
They include all-female bands and edgy themes that push back at traditional gender roles and even make fun of derogatory names. At one recent feminist-themed block party, hundreds of women dressed up as animals they said they had been called on the streets: cows, piranhas, hens and cobras, among others.
Roma Neptune, a 29-year-old high school sociology teacher, says learning to play the agogo - a percussion instrument that, like all others during Carnival, is usually played by men - has been empowering. However, she is disillusioned by men who claim to be supportive but are not.
""They say they are against machismo but won't put their hands in the fire when a woman is in dangerous situation, said Neptune, who dressed as a cow and played in the band.
Anderson Semme, one of a few dozen men at the same block party, agreed.
""Men's role is to recognize we were wrong for a long time and now do the right thing, said Semme, a 34-year-old computer technician.
As she listened to the music with her 3-year-old daughter, Maria Marzal reflected on why she wanted to join the party. The emergency room nurse said that every shift she sees at least one woman who has been raped.
""It's a real fear, a cruel fear, said Marzal, 27.
Last year, military police in Rio received 2,154 calls about violence against women during Carnival. Noting that figure means one woman was assaulted every few minutes, security officials and several non-government groups that have launched campaigns against harassment.
Thousands of stickers are being handed out with messages like ""No' is no!' and ""Grabbing me won't get you a kiss! Websites encourage women report harassment and direct them to police stations.
Maj. Claudia Morais, a Rio police officer who focuses on crimes against women, says the discussion is a step in the right direction, but that women must go beyond that and make reports when incidents happen.
Recent changes in the law have made it easier to prosecute aggressors for rape even if there wasn't intercourse, added Morais, who gave the example of a man who has been charged with rape for recently ejaculating on a woman in a public bus.
""At the very least, a guy who gets arrested and goes before a judge will think twice about assaulting a woman in the future, she said.

","Orlando Sentinel; Orlando, Fla.","Feb 9, 2018","United States, Orlando, Fla.",Newspapers,News,Bangladesh Brazil Rio de Janeiro Brazil Michigan Mexico Texas Montana Netherlands United States--US Venezuela Philippines Kansas North Carolina Taiwan,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/1999453566?accountid=4840,Indictments; Sex crimes; Immigration; Deportation; Trials; Genetic engineering; Earthquakes; Murders & murder attempts,General Interest Periodicals--United States,"FORT WORTH, Texas - A Texas prosecutor on Thursday dismissed 13 cases stemming from a 2015 shootout in Waco involving bikers and police and recused himself from two others, placing into doubt the criminal prosecution of the more than 130 bikers still awaiting trial. 
The actions came hours before a scheduled hearing for Jorge Salinas, whose case was among those dismissed. Current and former staff had been due to speak at the hearing about corruption allegations against District Attorney Abel Reyna, who faces a Republican primary election in March. The hearing was canceled. 
According to a motion filed Thursday, the prosecutor dismissed Salinas' case ""in order to focus its efforts and resources on co-defendants with a higher level of culpability."" 
The May 2015 shootout involving members of the Bandidos and Cossacks motorcycle clubs outside a Twin Peaks restaurant left nine bikers dead and 20 injured. Local police arrested 177 bikers after the mayhem, and more than 150 people were eventually indicted on felony charges of engaging in organized criminal activity resulting in the deaths and injuries. 
Ballistics evidence showed that police bullets struck four bikers, killing at least two of them. The three officers involved were cleared by an internal investigation.
Nearly three years later, only one biker, Bandido chapter president Christopher ""Jake"" Carrizal, has been tried. Carrizal's November trial resulted in a mistrial when jurors were unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The second biker set for trial rejected a plea deal in December. 
ICC to open preliminary probes in Philippines and Venezuela
THE HAGUE, Netherlands - The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced Thursday that she is opening preliminary probes into alleged crimes by security forces in the Philippines and Venezuela.
Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said that the probe on Venezuela will look at allegations that since April 2017 government forces ""frequently used excessive force to ... put down demonstrations,"" and abused some opposition members in detention.
The Philippines probe will focus on allegations since July 2016 that thousands of people have been killed in the government's war on drugs. 
A Filipino lawyer last year presented documents to the court which he said had evidence of the involvement of President Rodrigo Duterte in the extra-judicial killings of suspected drug dealers and other crime suspects.
Mich. Sen. Stabenow: Give me 'five minutes' with Larry Nassar
CHARLOTTE, Mich. - Sen. Debbie Stabenow says she was disappointed that an enraged father was prevented from punching Larry Nassar in a Michigan courtroom last week, saying she ""would have liked five minutes"" with the disgraced sports doctor accused of sexually abusing more than 260 women and girls. 
""All of us understand how destructive and how outrageous this perversion and (Nassar's) actions have been,"" Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, said Wednesday Washington.
""As a mom and as a grandmother who now has a young granddaughter in sports, I thought, you know, I would have liked five minutes with this guy,"" Stabenow said of Nassar, 54, a former Michigan State University doctor, who has been sentenced to decades in prison for sexual assault. 
Man facing deportation from Kansas gets temporary stay
LAWRENCE, Kan. - An adjunct college chemistry instructor living in Kansas who faced imminent deportation to Bangladesh has been granted a temporary stay. 
Lawyers representing 55-year-old Syed Ahmed Jamal announced Thursday that a judge issued the temporary stay and gave the Department of Homeland Security until Feb. 15 to respond to a motion to stay the deportation and re-open immigration proceedings. 
Jamal was arrested Jan. 24 at his home in Lawrence. He arrived legally in the U.S. in 1987, but after pursuing a doctorate degree, he overstayed his visa. Since his visa expired, he has been allowed to stay in the U.S. and report regularly to immigration authorities. He and his Bangladeshi wife have three children who are American citizens. 
Final checks sent to sterilization victims in N.C.
RALEIGH, N.C. - The third and final compensation payment has been mailed to sterilization victims, marking the end of a 15-year pursuit of financial help for people who suffered under North Carolina's eugenics program. 
The state Department of Administration said it mailed letters and an enclosed check of almost $10,500 to victims Thursday. Victims with approved claims received their first payment of $20,000 each in October 2014. A second payment of $15,000 each was mailed in November 2015. 
About 7,600 people were sterilized under North Carolina's eugenics program before it ended in 1974. The N.C. Industrial Commission certified 220 victims.
The payments were made after a decision by the N.C. Court of Appeals rejecting arguments from the heirs of some victims about the law. 
Carnival ready to kick off with more security planned in Rio
RIO DE JANEIRO - Authorities in Rio de Janeiro state said Thursday that security is being beefed up as the world-famous Carnival bash begins, following a wave of violence caused by gangs. 
Gov. Luiz Fernando Pezao said in a news conference that security forces will now total more than 17,000 statewide per day. That includes 2,000 extra agents who were off duty and will now work during the bash. 
Last year Rio used almost 12,000 policemen during Carnival, but it also counted on the help of 9,000 members of the country's armed forces. Brazil's most popular Carnival party starts Friday and ends Tuesday. 
Gov. Pezao also promised to pay policemen more than $20 million in delayed salaries and bring back a bonus program that was downsized due to the state's financial crisis. 
Authorities in Mexico's Gulf coast state of Veracruz announced charges Thursday of ""forced disappearance"" against 19 current or former state police officials and officers, saying they kidnapped and killed 15 innocent civilians. The governor said the victims included two women and two minors. 
Montana wildlife officials are recommending against holding a grizzly bear hunt in 2018 after the animals lost their federal protections across a three-state region around Yellowstone National Park. An official said Thursday the state wants to demonstrate its commitment to the grizzly's long-term recovery.

The actions came hours before a scheduled hearing for Jorge Salinas, whose case was among those dismissed. Current and former staff had been due to speak at the hearing about corruption allegations against District Attorney Abel Reyna, who faces a Republican primary election in March. The hearing was canceled. 
According to a motion filed Thursday, the prosecutor dismissed Salinas' case ""in order to focus its efforts and resources on co-defendants with a higher level of culpability."" 
The May 2015 shootout involving members of the Bandidos and Cossacks motorcycle clubs outside a Twin Peaks restaurant left nine bikers dead and 20 injured. Local police arrested 177 bikers after the mayhem, and more than 150 people were eventually indicted on felony charges of engaging in organized criminal activity resulting in the deaths and injuries. 
Ballistics evidence showed that police bullets struck four bikers, killing at least two of them. The three officers involved were cleared by an internal investigation.
Nearly three years later, only one biker, Bandido chapter president Christopher ""Jake"" Carrizal, has been tried. Carrizal's November trial resulted in a mistrial when jurors were unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The second biker set for trial rejected a plea deal in December. 
ICC to open preliminary probes in Philippines and Venezuela
THE HAGUE, Netherlands - The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced Thursday that she is opening preliminary probes into alleged crimes by security forces in the Philippines and Venezuela.
Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said that the probe on Venezuela will look at allegations that since April 2017 government forces ""frequently used excessive force to ... put down demonstrations,"" and abused some opposition members in detention.
The Philippines probe will focus on allegations since July 2016 that thousands of people have been killed in the government's war on drugs. 
A Filipino lawyer last year presented documents to the court which he said had evidence of the involvement of President Rodrigo Duterte in the extra-judicial killings of suspected drug dealers and other crime suspects.
Mich. Sen. Stabenow: Give me 'five minutes' with Larry Nassar
CHARLOTTE, Mich. - Sen. Debbie Stabenow says she was disappointed that an enraged father was prevented from punching Larry Nassar in a Michigan courtroom last week, saying she ""would have liked five minutes"" with the disgraced sports doctor accused of sexually abusing more than 260 women and girls. 
""All of us understand how destructive and how outrageous this perversion and (Nassar's) actions have been,"" Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, said Wednesday Washington.
""As a mom and as a grandmother who now has a young granddaughter in sports, I thought, you know, I would have liked five minutes with this guy,"" Stabenow said of Nassar, 54, a former Michigan State University doctor, who has been sentenced to decades in prison for sexual assault. 
Man facing deportation from Kansas gets temporary stay
LAWRENCE, Kan. - An adjunct college chemistry instructor living in Kansas who faced imminent deportation to Bangladesh has been granted a temporary stay. 
Lawyers representing 55-year-old Syed Ahmed Jamal announced Thursday that a judge issued the temporary stay and gave the Department of Homeland Security until Feb. 15 to respond to a motion to stay the deportation and re-open immigration proceedings. 
Jamal was arrested Jan. 24 at his home in Lawrence. He arrived legally in the U.S. in 1987, but after pursuing a doctorate degree, he overstayed his visa. Since his visa expired, he has been allowed to stay in the U.S. and report regularly to immigration authorities. He and his Bangladeshi wife have three children who are American citizens. 
Final checks sent to sterilization victims in N.C.
RALEIGH, N.C. - The third and final compensation payment has been mailed to sterilization victims, marking the end of a 15-year pursuit of financial help for people who suffered under North Carolina's eugenics program. 
The state Department of Administration said it mailed letters and an enclosed check of almost $10,500 to victims Thursday. Victims with approved claims received their first payment of $20,000 each in October 2014. A second payment of $15,000 each was mailed in November 2015. 
About 7,600 people were sterilized under North Carolina's eugenics program before it ended in 1974. The N.C. Industrial Commission certified 220 victims.
The payments were made after a decision by the N.C. Court of Appeals rejecting arguments from the heirs of some victims about the law. 
Carnival ready to kick off with more security planned in Rio
RIO DE JANEIRO - Authorities in Rio de Janeiro state said Thursday that security is being beefed up as the world-famous Carnival bash begins, following a wave of violence caused by gangs.

Authorities in Mexico's Gulf coast state of Veracruz announced charges Thursday of ""forced disappearance"" against 19 current or former state police officials and officers, saying they kidnapped and killed 15 innocent civilians. The governor said the victims included two women and two minors. 

Montana wildlife officials are recommending against holding a grizzly bear hunt in 2018 after the animals lost their federal protections across a three-state region around Yellowstone National Park. An official said Thursday the state wants to demonstrate its commitment to the grizzly's long-term recovery.

The actions came hours before a scheduled hearing for Jorge Salinas, whose case was among those dismissed. Current and former staff had been due to speak at the hearing about corruption allegations against District Attorney Abel Reyna, who faces a Republican primary election in March. The hearing was canceled. 
According to a motion filed Thursday, the prosecutor dismissed Salinas' case ""in order to focus its efforts and resources on co-defendants with a higher level of culpability."" 
The May 2015 shootout involving members of the Bandidos and Cossacks motorcycle clubs outside a Twin Peaks restaurant left nine bikers dead and 20 injured. Local police arrested 177 bikers after the mayhem, and more than 150 people were eventually indicted on felony charges of engaging in organized criminal activity resulting in the deaths and injuries. 
Ballistics evidence showed that police bullets struck four bikers, killing at least two of them. The three officers involved were cleared by an internal investigation.
Nearly three years later, only one biker, Bandido chapter president Christopher ""Jake"" Carrizal, has been tried. Carrizal's November trial resulted in a mistrial when jurors were unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The second biker set for trial rejected a plea deal in December. 
ICC to open preliminary probes in Philippines and Venezuela
THE HAGUE, Netherlands - The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced Thursday that she is opening preliminary probes into alleged crimes by security forces in the Philippines and Venezuela.
Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said that the probe on Venezuela will look at allegations that since April 2017 government forces ""frequently used excessive force to ... put down demonstrations,"" and abused some opposition members in detention.
The Philippines probe will focus on allegations since July 2016 that thousands of people have been killed in the government's war on drugs. 
A Filipino lawyer last year presented documents to the court which he said had evidence of the involvement of President Rodrigo Duterte in the extra-judicial killings of suspected drug dealers and other crime suspects.
Mich. Sen. Stabenow: Give me 'five minutes' with Larry Nassar
CHARLOTTE, Mich. - Sen. Debbie Stabenow says she was disappointed that an enraged father was prevented from punching Larry Nassar in a Michigan courtroom last week, saying she ""would have liked five minutes"" with the disgraced sports doctor accused of sexually abusing more than 260 women and girls. 
""All of us understand how destructive and how outrageous this perversion and (Nassar's) actions have been,"" Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, said Wednesday Washington.
""As a mom and as a grandmother who now has a young granddaughter in sports, I thought, you know, I would have liked five minutes with this guy,"" Stabenow said of Nassar, 54, a former Michigan State University doctor, who has been sentenced to decades in prison for sexual assault. 
Man facing deportation from Kansas gets temporary stay
LAWRENCE, Kan. - An adjunct college chemistry instructor living in Kansas who faced imminent deportation to Bangladesh has been granted a temporary stay. 
Lawyers representing 55-year-old Syed Ahmed Jamal announced Thursday that a judge issued the temporary stay and gave the Department of Homeland Security until Feb. 15 to respond to a motion to stay the deportation and re-open immigration proceedings. 
Jamal was arrested Jan. 24 at his home in Lawrence. He arrived legally in the U.S. in 1987, but after pursuing a doctorate degree, he overstayed his visa. Since his visa expired, he has been allowed to stay in the U.S. and report regularly to immigration authorities. He and his Bangladeshi wife have three children who are American citizens. 
Final checks sent to sterilization victims in N.C.
RALEIGH, N.C. - The third and final compensation payment has been mailed to sterilization victims, marking the end of a 15-year pursuit of financial help for people who suffered under North Carolina's eugenics program. 
The state Department of Administration said it mailed letters and an enclosed check of almost $10,500 to victims Thursday. Victims with approved claims received their first payment of $20,000 each in October 2014. A second payment of $15,000 each was mailed in November 2015. 
About 7,600 people were sterilized under North Carolina's eugenics program before it ended in 1974. The N.C. Industrial Commission certified 220 victims.
The payments were made after a decision by the N.C. Court of Appeals rejecting arguments from the heirs of some victims about the law. 
Carnival ready to kick off with more security planned in Rio
RIO DE JANEIRO - Authorities in Rio de Janeiro state said Thursday that security is being beefed up as the world-famous Carnival bash begins, following a wave of violence caused by gangs. 
Gov. Luiz Fernando Pezao said in a news conference that security forces will now total more than 17,000 statewide per day. That includes 2,000 extra agents who were off duty and will now work during the bash. 
Last year Rio used almost 12,000 policemen during Carnival, but it also counted on the help of 9,000 members of the country's armed forces. Brazil's most popular Carnival party starts Friday and ends Tuesday. 
Gov. Pezao also promised to pay policemen more than $20 million in delayed salaries and bring back a bonus program that was downsized due to the state's financial crisis.

A man kept making advances, and three times Jacob told him she wasn’t interested. Suddenly, he grabbed her by a leg and shoved his hand up her shorts.
The man was kicked out, but “I was shaken,” Jacob said. “When I told my girlfriends what happened, they started sharing their stories too. Every single one of them had something to say. They had all been through it before.”
The assault occurred last year just before Carnival, Brazil’s festive pre-Lenten celebration known for its big crowds, loud music, glittery costumes and hedonistic street parties. Jacob, a stylist from Rio de Janeiro, and other women decided it was time to speak out against sexual harassment and assaults during the street parties known as blocos.
According to feminist group Think Olga, 99.6% of women in Brazil have been catcalled. The Brazilian Forum on Public Security, a private group, also reports that every 11 minutes, a woman is raped in the South American country, but just 10% report their assaults.
Last year’s Carnival saw the number of sexual assault complaints across Brazil jump 90% compared to the same four days in 2016, according to the Secretariat of Policies for Women. The secretariat said the increase in complaints — which are registered when victims call 180, a number dedicated to reporting crimes against women — was a result of government campaigns to stop this type of violence.
Local governments across Brazil have launched campaigns in recent years to stamp out crimes against women during Carnival. Some states coined their own slogans, including Rio’s “costumes are not invitations,” Paraíba’s “forcing a kiss is a crime” and Bahia’s “respect the girls.” 
Jacob and a group of friends decided to add their voices to the movement and create their own campaign, Não é Não, or No Means No. The best way to get their message across, they decided, was by putting it directly on their bodies.
“We had already been planning on having temporary tattoos made for our [Carnival] costumes,” she said. “There was a moment when we just looked at each other and said, ‘We have to make tattoos for women that say ‘no means no.’ We have to protect each other.’
“It wouldn’t make sense to have stickers made with that message. It had to be something that we could carry with us on our bodies.”
Within 48 hours, the friends created a WhatsApp group of 40 women to fund the production of 4,000 temporary tattoos. It was all done on the fly — nobody had planned on creating a campaign against sexual harassment and assault for Carnival’s kickoff the following week — but they managed to get them printed in time to hand them out for free to women at Rio’s blocos.
This year, the campaign has a much wider reach.
After setting up a crowd-funding page to lessen the burden on the 40 women they had counted on financially in 2017, Jacob was surprised to see how quickly they reached their first target of 4,000 tattoos for $2,360. She was even more shocked when the campaign almost tripled that amount. She and her friends were able to print 25,000 tattoos with the $6,443 raised from 355 donors.
With time to plan, Jacob and the four other women who work with her on production — Nanda Barbosa, Luiza Borges, Barbara Menchise and Julia Parucker — also created distribution partnerships with bloco organizers in São Paulo, Salvador, Belo Horizonte and Recife. This year’s Carnival started Friday and lasts till Feb. 13, the day before Ash Wednesday and the start of Lent.
Individual women who heard about the No Means No campaign have also volunteered to hand out the temporary tattoos in their cities, and plans for a new campaign for International Women’s Day are already underway.
While the campaign encourages and welcomes the support of men, Jacob wants to make it clear that No Means No is something created by women, for women. It’s not just a means of getting their message across to men, but also about creating a sense of security for women who want to attend blocos.
“With the tattoos, it’s easy to see who is a part of No Means No, so it creates a type of support group for women,” Jacob said. “If they need to ask for help, they know who they can reach out to. They know they’re not alone.”

In state capital Salvador, visitors can enjoy the city's time-honoured trios eletricos (massive ""pied piper"" style parties with sound trucks that carry live performances throughout the city) to the sound of major national attractions, including Baiana System, Bell Marques, Harmonia do Samba, Leo Santana, Baby do Brasil, Luis Caldas, Pitty, Avioes, Carla Perez and Anitta.
In total, a whopping 204 performances will liven up Salvador's Carnival. The main circuits (i.e. the paths followed by the trios eletricos) are Dodo (Barra), Osmar (Avenida) and Batatinha (Pelourinho). Amaralina, Cajazeiras, Castelo Branco and Piata are expected to be the busiest neighbourhoods of the city during the festivities.
There is much fun to be had outside Salvador as well. Many of the state's cities will offer their own attractions and afoxe, samba, reggae, axe, pop, MPB and fanfare concerts, with Porto Seguro, Itabuna and Juazeiro standing out among the most sought-out destinations. The Bahia government expects Carnival to inject R$ 2.3 billion in the state's economy.

A man kept making advances, and three times Jacob told him she wasn't interested. Suddenly, he grabbed her by a leg and shoved his hand up her shorts.
The man was kicked out, but ""I was shaken,"" Jacob said. ""When I told my girlfriends what happened, they started sharing their stories too. Every single one of them had something to say. They had all been through it before.""
The assault occurred last year just before Carnival, Brazil's festive pre-Lenten celebration known for its big crowds, loud music, glittery costumes and hedonistic street parties. Jacob, a stylist from Rio de Janeiro, and other women decided it was time to speak out against sexual harassment and assaults during the street parties known as blocos.

According to feminist group Think Olga, 99.6% of women in Brazil have been catcalled. The Brazilian Forum on Public Security, a private group, also reports that every 11 minutes a woman is raped in the South American country, but just 10% report their assaults.
Last year's Carnival saw the number of sexual assault complaints across Brazil jump 90% compared with the same four days in 2016, according to the Secretariat of Policies for Women. The secretariat said the increase in complaints -- which are registered when victims call 180, a number dedicated to reporting crimes against women -- was a result of government campaigns to stop this type of violence.
Local governments across Brazil have launched campaigns in recent years to stamp out crimes against women during Carnival. Some states coined their own slogans, including Rio's ""costumes are not invitations,"" Paraiba's ""forcing a kiss is a crime"" and Bahia's ""respect the girls.""
Jacob and a group of friends decided to add their voices to the movement and create their own campaign, Nao e Nao, or No Means No. The best way to get their message across, they decided, was by putting it directly on their bodies.
""We had already been planning on having temporary tattoos made for our [Carnival] costumes,"" she said. ""There was a moment when we just looked at each other and said, 'We have to make tattoos for women that say ""No Means No."" We have to protect each other.'
""It wouldn't make sense to have stickers made with that message. It had to be something that we could carry with us on our bodies.""
Within 48 hours, the friends created a WhatsApp group of 40 women to fund the production of 4,000 temporary tattoos. It was all done on the fly -- nobody had planned on creating a campaign against sexual harassment and assault for Carnival's kickoff the following week -- but they managed to get them printed in time to hand them out for free to women at Rio's blocos.
This year, the campaign has a much wider reach.
After setting up a crowdfunding page to lessen the burden on the 40 women they had counted on financially in 2017, Jacob was surprised to see how quickly they reached their first target of 4,000 tattoos for $2,360. She was even more shocked when the campaign almost tripled that amount. She and her friends were able to print 25,000 tattoos with the $6,443 raised from 355 donors.
With time to plan, Jacob and the four other women who work with her on production -- Nanda Barbosa, Luiza Borges, Barbara Menchise and Julia Parucker -- also created distribution partnerships with bloco organizers in Sao Paulo, Salvador, Belo Horizonte and Recife. This year's Carnival started Friday and lasts till Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday and the start of Lent.
Individual women who heard about the No Means No campaign have also volunteered to hand out the temporary tattoos in their cities, and plans for a new campaign for International Women's Day next month are already underway.
While the campaign encourages and welcomes the support of men, Jacob wants to make it clear that No Means No is created by women, for women. It's not just a means of getting their message across to men, but also about creating a sense of security for women who want to attend blocos.
""With the tattoos, it's easy to see who is a part of No Means No, so it creates a type of support group for women,"" Jacob said. ""If they need to ask for help, they know who they can reach out to. They know they're not alone.""

Residents have been lining up for hours in hopes of scoring a yellow fever vaccine amid an outbreak that has killed more than 20 people in the state.
But that didn’t stop thousands of people from pouring onto the streets on Friday as the city’s famed Carnival began, displaying Rio de Janeiro’s mesmerizing ability to keep chaos and carnage from derailing a party.
As samba schools had their first parades at the Sambódromo — a purpose-built stadium in which thousands of costumed performers appear each year — residents gathered for street parties that were heavier on politics and, many women hope, lighter on lasciviousness than years past.
The festivities, which officially run through Wednesday, have taken on a decidedly political tone as the country heads toward a presidential election in October .
Several blocos, as the informal groups that perform on the streets are called, plan to parody the country’s widely despised political elite. Mayor Marcelo Crivella, an evangelical pastor whose support for the annual event has been far from ebullient, is likely to be the subject of scorn.
President Michel Temer, meanwhile, will be honored by a bloco called “We have to maintain that, O.K.” The name references the president’s remarks to a businessman who was wearing a wire, which led prosecutors to charge Mr. Temer with corruption and obstruction of justice last year.
Politics weren’t the only topics at the front of mind during the elaborate festival, which is known for its debauchery. While the #MeToo movement has yet to reverberate strongly in Brazil, some women are demanding that men keep their hands to themselves during the drunken, sweaty, teeming days of Carnival.
Many have been staying cool with fans that say “No Means No.”

Rio de Janeiro: Rio's vast annual street celebration features copious amounts of sparkling microplastics that find their way into the marine food chain
With Rio's enormous carnival in full swing, the streets are full of revellers in colourful fancy dress, thronging the city's many samba street parties. And among the looks, there is one carnival constant: multicoloured glitter smeared over bare skin.
But now worries over glitter's damaging environmental impact are dampening the mood at the world's biggest party.
Concern is growing about the impact the tiny pieces of plastic -- called microplastics -- have on marine life. Last year the UK's Tops Days Nurseries Group banned glitter in a pre-Christmas drive and scientists called for it to be banned.
But while new ""sustainable glitter"" products are finding favour in Brazil with environmentally conscious carnival-goers, poorer Brazilians complain they are too expensive. Other carnival-goers say they are reducing their glitter consumption -- but not cutting it out.
At a Rio street party, known as a bloco, Angelica Nobrega, 37, wore non-sustainable glitter on her cheeks and said she was sceptical about environmental concerns.
""It is just one more thing to make the lives of Brazilians more difficult,"" she said. ""I think they are making it up.""
Felipe Gusmao, an adjunct professor of biodiversity and conservation at the Federal University of Sao Paulo's Marine Science Institute in Santos, said the problem with glitter is that it is usually made of microplastics, which are less than five millimetres in size and impossible to remove from the environment.
""Imagine the amount of glitter that is used in carnival, it's amazing,"" he said. ""We use it, we wash it and it goes straight to the water. That's the biggest problem.""
Although the damage from glitter itself is unknown, he said, there is evidence that microplastics have the potential to have a negative impact on marine life. Contaminants tend to stick to these tiny pieces of plastic which get into the food chain.
""We have studies showing the impacts of microplastics from the cellular level to the ecosystem level,"" Gusmao said.
And that includes human beings.
""Tiny animals at the base of the marine food chain can eat these particles, and both microplastics and their associated contaminants can be transferred to the animals up in the marine food chain,"" he said. ""Humans are at the top of the food chain, so both microplastics and the contaminants can potentially reach us.""
To counter this, several kinds of ""sustainable glitter"" are now on the market.
Maira Inae and Noemi Puig are the entrepreneurs behind a make-up line called Glitra, made of eucalyptus cellulose, wax and natural oils.
""People don't know that glitter is made of microplastics,"" Inae said. ""This is a problem all over the world.""
She was inspired by attending the Burning Man music and arts festival in the Nevada desert. Festival-goers take everything home with them afterwards and the festival prohibits glitter and sequins.
But at £12 ($17) for an 8-gram recyclable tin of Glitra in shops (or £10 online), the product is much more expensive than common glitter, sold in central Rio for as little as £6.50 a kilo.
""Sustainable alternatives are necessary,"" said Gabriela Cunha, 32, a journalist at a cable television channel, as she applied non-sustainable glitter before a street party in central Rio. ""But at this carnival, the alternatives on the market are too expensive.""
Instead, she was reducing her glitter consumption. ""It is just for today,"" she said.

For weeks now, the Cariocas, as Rio natives are known, have donned feathers and paint, mobbed the streets, and belted out provocative anthems.One of this season’s biggest hits? Al, Al Gilmar, a sendup of controversial Supreme Court justice Gilmar Mendes, famed for ordering the release of big shots jailed in the country’s rolling corruption scandal. (The former Rio health secretary, accused of diverting $90 million [Dh331 million] from state coffers, was Mendes’s latest beneficiary.) ‘Hello, hello, Gilmar/I’m in jail, come set me free’, goes the refrain of the song, which quickly became a hit on the web.OK, you won’t hear this mischievous number in the Sambdromo, the grand arena where battalions of samba dancers vie for glory and audience share. And no doubt, the headline show — featuring giant floats, columns of gyrating dancers, and nifty special effects — is a wonder. “Kind of like Las Vegas meets the Roman circus,” Nelson Motta, a popular music producer and critic, told me.Yet, Brazil’s Carnival spirit never fit so easily in a concrete box. Since late January, the number of street parties and parades has soared with the summer temperatures, snarling traffic, emptying offices, and scuttling any hint of metropolitan normalcy. Driving this year’s merriment are rambling bards like the Band of Ipanema, and block parties like Christ’s Armpit (which gathers below Rio’s Christ the Redeemer statue), the massive Cordon of the Black Ball, and, my favourite, Sympathy is Almost Love, which this year spoofed Rio’s evangelical mayor, Marcelo Crivella.Sure, not everyone is enchanted: Outbound passengers despaired when 1.5 million revellers blocked the airport thoroughfare last Sunday, and my wife’s usual 10-minute commute has become an hour-long crawl through a beer-splashed gauntlet.With the city’s crime rate spiking, 12 million people out of work across Brazil, and much of the political class under scrutiny for graft and payola, you might well ask, as a friend of mine did: What’s to celebrate?Silly question. Carnival in Venice is more elegant, and the Andean version in Oruro, Bolivia, just as colourful. However, few societies have done more than Brazil to turn the date on the Catholic calendar into a collective catharsis, a moment when, with a headdress and some glitter, the poor become royalty and miseries, memes.If once Rio’s Carnival was the privilege of tony ballrooms, it took its cues and its pulse from the streets. Samba got its start more than a century ago, when an ambitious city boss razed the slums to hurl up a monumental downtown inspired by Parisian urban planning. The poor picked through the rubble for what remained and trudged up the hillsides, inventing the favela and samba, as biographer Lira Neto writes in the engaging first volume of his trilogy, Uma Histria do Samba (A History of Samba).Samba was squalour made song, an amalgam of African rhythms, Iberian chords and European melodies. As samba musicians travelled, they added jazz to the mix, creating one of those rare moments in a nation’s culture when the best music was also its most popular.True, polite Brazilian society balked at the new sound at first. When samba ace Pixinguinha and his band returned from a successful tour of France in the early 1920s, having added instruments like the banjo and saxophone and rhythms like ragtime and the Charleston to the repertoire, critics blasted them as turncoats, “aping imported fashions”, as one wrote.Such parochialism has resurfaced again and again, plaguing the country’s itinerant talents from Carmen Miranda to bossa nova’s Antnio Carlos Jobim. Yet, the resistance wouldn’t last. Samba’s envoys did only what Brazilians at their best, from maestros to urban planners, have always done: Gobble up global styles and genres, and repurpose them into something of their own. In time, samba became the national sound, and the favela masters, its icons. Every year, Carnival was a much anticipated contest among the country’s most talented composers — Ary Barroso, Cartola, Ismael Silva and Noel Rosa — whose sambas enchanted the ballrooms and the street parties.Perhaps it was inevitable that Brazil’s successful high-low culture ended up encastled. Enter the Sambdromo, a great stadium sculpted of reinforced concrete by storied modernist architect Oscar Niemeyer. The Sambdromo was Broadway to Brazil’s popular opera, and every year the Carnival contest grew bigger and more exorbitant. Beer companies, telephone operators and, more controversially, even foreign governments poured fortunes into the official parade.Yet, grandeur didn’t do much for samba. “Like on Broadway, the songs are overshadowed by the theatrics,” author Ruy Castro, a samba scholar and biographer of Carmen Miranda, told me. “The official pageant drowned out street carnival.”Sure, the Sambadrome can still be sensational. There may be no inebriant like a 700-piece percussion section thundering by the bleachers. But the music itself had become predictable, the same song droning on for 80 minutes. “The arena took Carnival out of the street and put it behind walls,” anthropologist Roberto DaMatta, a Carnival scholar, told me.Perhaps because of that very rigidity, the street festival is now flourishing again. “It’s a party that no one owns, no media group controls, and where the crowd sets the pace,” said Motta. So much the better for Carnival’s soundtrack, where once again revellers are flirting with a wide range of dance rhythms, such as Brazilian country, reggaeton, and funk. There’s even a Carnival band dedicated to mingling samba and the Beatles, Sargento Pimenta (Sergeant Pepper’s).Brazil’s consumer retailers have taken note. They know a money note when they hear it.— BloombergMac Margolis writes about Latin America for Bloomberg View.

500,000 more tourists expected this year

RIO DE JANEIRO - Once a party of luxury and glamour, Brazil's most famous Carnival is increasingly being dominated by thrifty tourists more interested in free street parties than the pricey samba school parades.
Cariocas, as Rio de Janeiro residents are known, and tourists used to spend a lot on Carnival parade tickets and costumes. But a grinding economic crisis in Latin America's largest nation and the rise of ""blocos,"" as local street parties are known, are changing the nature of the big bash.
Rio's tourism agency expects a quarter of all visitors to spend less than $100 a day, compared to 12 percent who did so last year.
""We have millions of people willing to take to the streets for the free and cool blocos, while the samba school parades have been frozen in time and become very expensive,"" Carnival historian Luiz Antonio Simas said. ""For tourists who want to spend less, it is an obvious choice.""
Rio's tourism agency expects 1.5 million tourists to descend on the city between Friday and Tuesday, almost 500,000 more than last year. But city revenues during Carnival are expected to be roughly the same as last year, about $1 billion.
Most of the visitors are unlikely to attend parades with the traditional samba schools that have prepared all year for the event. Instead, they will hang out alongside thousands of others at some of the estimated 600 block parties. In 2007, when Brazil's economy was booming, Rio's Carnival had only 300 block parties.
Rio authorities and businesses are also shifting their priorities toward the streets and out of the Sambadrome, where the samba schools perform.
While Mayor Marcelo Crivella cut more than $1.5 million in funding for the samba school parades, which represents almost half the budget of some schools, he increased the number of portable street toilets by a few thousand, to 32,560. For the first time, more than 3,000 private security agents will be at work during the party, most protecting street parties.
Much of the appeal of Rio's street parties is the variety of themes. Any costume, or no costume at all, is fine, and revelers can choose according to their musical taste and location.
The street parties are free, or close to it, and partiers spend what they want on the food and drink being offered.
The experience at the Sambadrome, where top schools parade into the wee hours on two consecutive nights, dates back to 1932. Attendees hear some of the best drummers in the world as they watch massive and gaudily decorated floats roll by, while beautiful people - some wearing very little - sing and dance to samba music.
The Sambadrome parade does try to maintain appeal for thrifty visitors with about 14,000 tickets that cost as little as $3. But those go quickly and are not close to the best sections. The most expensive tickets cost about $2,000.
Parade financial director Heron Schneider says that selling more cheap tickets won't make the parade more accessible because scalpers would quickly buy them up and resell them for higher prices. He believes low-cost tourists can find good options at the Sambadrome if they really want to go.
""I don't see a conflict between the parade and the blocos. You can go to both,"" Schneider said. ""They are different in nature; ours is a show and a competition that has to be paid for. It is not sheer fun.""
Rita Fernandes, head of Rio's street party association, says the groups that organize them are struggling despite all the people attending. She believes block parties need some public funds and to find sponsors.
""To keep those tourists coming, the street parties need money too,"" she said. ""Nowadays we get nothing to improve people's experience.""
The local hotel association expects 85 percent of rooms to be taken for the bash, higher than the last couple of years but still far below the nearly maxed-out occupancy of years past.
Many low-spending tourists in Rio will come from the neighboring state of Sao Paulo, the country's most populous.
Television producer Rodrigo Rodrigues, 35, is one of those who will stay far from the Sambadrome and expensive hotels. He will travel six hours to Rio by bus, stay at a cousin's small apartment far from the beaches and cook his own food. - (AP)",Rio Carnival evolves into low-cost street pageant,5,4272,headnote

Born in the Big Easy, my sisters and I were always excited to build cardboard floats filled with candy and beads to imitate the huge floats that flooded the French Quarter and Bourbon Street for Mardi Gras parades. If I was lucky, I’d be the one to find the small plastic baby inside the tasty purple, green and gold King Cake. I remember going to parades and seeing the second-liners fill the streets, catching beads thrown to us from the floats above and being picked up in the wave of bounce music, jazz bands and dancers. And how could I forget gathering to eat crawfish and gumbo after the long day of festivities? If only I could go back.

Mardi Gras is a Christian holiday celebrated in many countries throughout the world with large Roman Catholic populations. Mardi Gras, which falls on Feb. 13 this year, directly translates to “Fat Tuesday” from French. The name of the holiday originated thousands of years ago in Europe because of the binge eating that would occur in the days leading up to Lent, the period of fasting between Ash Wednesday and Easter Sunday.

Fat Tuesday can fall on any Tuesday between Feb. 3 and March 9 and is the biggest and perhaps the most important day of celebration. However, the exciting Carnival celebrations go on from Jan. 6, the Twelfth Night or Feast of Epiphany, until the midnight of Fat Tuesday.

When Christianity spread from Rome to various parts of the world, so did Mardi Gras. Today, Brazil, Venice and New Orleans are among the top places in the world to celebrate the festivities of the holiday, attracting thousands of tourists every year.

Tisch freshman Abby Tawiah doesn’t feel that she can personally identify with Mardi Gras.

“I’ve never been one to celebrate a holiday that I have no connection to,” Tawiah said. “I’m from West Africa and have no family from here. I’m sure the holiday means more to the native people of Orleans, and I wouldn’t want to appropriate that.” 

Due to the French influence in New Orleans, Mardi Gras remains a rich custom for the Cajun and Creole people of Louisiana. Krewes, which are organizations that arrange parades during the carnival season, have remained a paramount part of the carnival culture in New Orleans over the years. There are tons of Krewes in New Orleans, such as the Krewe of Zulu, the Mardi Gras Indians and many others.

Nonetheless, we can give credit to the Krewe of Rex for establishing purple, green and gold as the official colors of Mardi Gras. Each color has a special meaning: purple symbolizes justice, gold signifies power and green represents faith.

Colored purple, green and gold, King Cake is essential for any Mardi Gras celebration. This cake, rich in color and flavor, originated in France in 1870 as a cross between a coffee cake and a French pastry. In every glittery King Cake comes a tiny doll, which many people say represents baby Jesus. The meaning of finding the baby in the cake isn’t very clear, but it either signifies prosperity and good luck or marks you as responsible for providing a King Cake at the next celebration.

While most NYU students have heard of Mardi Gras, few students plan to celebrate the festive holiday this year. CAS freshman Lauren Rodriguez stated that she did not share the excitement of some of her peers.

“Yeah, I’ve heard of Mardi Gras before, but I don’t plan to celebrate it this year,” Rodriguez said.

CAS freshman Charlotte Dankwah is not celebrating the festival this year.

“I’ve heard of Mardi Gras, and I know that it’s a big French holiday celebrated in Louisiana,” Dankwah said. “I even know of a few events happening in [New York City] to celebrate, but I’m just too busy to go.”

SPS freshman Matthew Oscodar is more willing to see how New York City celebrates Mardi Gras.

“I’d be willing to celebrate it if I knew of any events happening here in the city,” Oscodar said.

Some students, like Steinhardt senior Marco Chan, are trying to keep the Mardi Gras spirit alive even if they are not in New Orleans.

“I have heard of Mardi Gras but never celebrated it in the past,” Chan said. “But this week, the [Faculty Fellows in Residence] on [Lipton Residence Hall’s] 11th floor are having a party in their room to celebrate and will be welcoming residents in with foods from Louisiana. I definitely plan to stop by.”

The city that never sleeps doesn’t sleep on this holiday either. There are various bars, jazz lounge and dance clubs that give you a taste of the Big Easy right here in the Big Apple. If you want a funk-filled night, check out B.B. King Blues Club & Grill. The House of Yes in Brooklyn is hosting its annual Mardi Gras event with circus performances, good company and great music. Whether you plan to travel down to Canal Street in New Orleans for the holiday or Canal Street in New York City, Mardi Gras is a time of fun and celebration that everyone should experience.

The television network TV Globo on Wednesday showed video of gunfire between rival drug gangs, teenagers punching tourists in areas usually considered relatively safe and a police officer narrowly escaping after several people attacked him in front of his home.
Gov. Luiz Fernando Pezão of the state of Rio acknowledged there were not enough police officers on hand during the first couple days of Carnival, though more than 17,000 officers worked in Rio State each day during the festivities.
“We were not prepared,” Mr. Pezão said. “There was a failure on the first two days, and then we brought backup for police. I think there has been a mistake in our part.”
Statistics from the Friday to Tuesday festivities have not yet been released. Mr. Pezão said the number of firearms confiscated by the authorities was “incredible.”
A year after hosting the 2016 Olympics, Rio is experiencing a spike in violence. Days before Carnival, rival drug gangs closed major transportation arteries of the city.
Last year Rio used almost 12,000 police officers during Carnival, and also counted on the help of 9,000 members of the country’s armed forces. This time there was no federal aid during the festivities.
Politicians avoided Rio during one of the most political Carnivals in Brazil’s history, with revelers singling out for criticism Mr. Pezão, President Michel Temer and especially Mayor Marcelo Crivella, an evangelical bishop who is no fan of Carnival and left the city for Europe.
The samba school Beija-Flor de Nilópolis won the parade title on Wednesday in Rio’s Sambadrome using corruption as a theme. One of its floats portrayed a rat below the building of the state oil company Petrobras, which is at the center of a corruption scandal that has engulfed politicians across Latin America.

 Crowd favorite Paraiso do Tuiuti finished in a surprising second place, likely because of its political tone. The samba-school's anti-slavery theme attacked Temer's labor reform and the president himself. One of Tuiuti's floats featured a vampire wearing a presidential sash. 
 Next week Temer, whose popularity is at single-digits, wants to push through a reform of Brazil's pension system. Analysts have said bill is unlikely to pass with October's presidential election approaching.

",New York Times (Online); New York,"Feb 16, 2018","United States, New York","Blogs, Podcasts, & Websites",News,Brazil Rio de Janeiro Brazil,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/2002508624?accountid=4840,Organized crime; Professional soccer; Shortages; Armed forces,General Interest Periodicals--United States,"RIO DE JANEIRO — After months of escalating violence in Rio de Janeiro that included television coverage of tourists being chased and beaten by robbers during the famed Carnival festivities, Brazil’s president on Friday ordered the military to take control of public security in the state.
It is the first federal intervention in a state since Brazil’s return to democracy in the 1980s, and it is seen by some as a bid by the president , Michel Temer, to improve his favorability ratings rather than as a measure to tackle crime.
The decree signed by Mr. Temer on Friday afternoon falls short of a full intervention in the state government. While the military will take control of security, Gov. Luiz Fernando Pezão will continue to run the state government of Rio de Janeiro.
“This decision is motivated more by politics than sound public administration,” said Kennedy Alencar, a political commentator and blogger in Brasília, Brazil’s capital. “Now the focus of news will be on the president’s federal intervention to address an issue that concerns the whole country.”
The decision was made two days after the end of Carnival, when about 1.5 million tourists descended on Rio, Brazil’s second-largest city, for the annual parades and partying. But this year the festivities were marred by mass robberies, the looting of stores and shootouts between the police and drug gangs.
The decree confers broad authority on the military to restore order. It also places police forces, which have had shortages of personnel and equipment, under the command of a general, Walter Souza Braga Netto, who oversees military operations in the eastern part of the country.
“Together, the police and the armed forces will combat and confront those who have kidnapped our cities,” Mr. Temer said at the signing ceremony in Brasília. “Prison cells will no longer be thieves’ personal offices. Public squares will no longer be the reception halls for organized crime.”
Experts questioned the timing and motivation of the decision. It comes as Mr. Temer, who took office after his predecessor was impeached in 2016, has been weighing whether he has a chance of being elected president in October, despite his single-digit approval numbers.
According to a poll last month, 38 percent of Brazilians said public security was a major concern as they considered whom to vote for. In Rio de Janeiro, violent crime, after gradually declining for almost a decade, has surged in the past two years .
In 2017, there were 6,731 violent deaths in the state of Rio, or 40 per 100,000 residents — the highest level in eight years. Carjackings, robberies of cellphones and kidnappings also increased.
The decree not only shows Mr. Temer being tough on crime, it also delays a vote on an unpopular legislative proposal on pensions that looked increasingly doomed to failure. Under the Constitution, Brazilian lawmakers are barred from making broad legal changes during a military intervention imposed by decree.
“On the political level, Temer might be killing two birds with one stone,” said Christopher Harig, an expert on civilian-military relations in Brazil at King’s College London. “At the same time he creates an excuse for not being able to pass the social security reform.”
Mr. Temer, who announced that he would travel to Rio on Saturday for a meeting on security, insisted that the pension overhaul could still be voted on by temporarily lifting the decree.
Brazil’s military leaders have expressed deep concern as the federal government has increasingly turned to the armed forces to quell outbreaks of violence around the country.
Gen. Eduardo Villas Bôas, the country’s top military commander, said recently that the armed forces could not be expected to solve a security crisis rooted in longstanding problems that other government agencies had failed to meaningfully address.
“Combating organized crime requires effective action by the government in economic and social spheres, in order to make drug trafficking less appealing in areas where a large segment of the population is grappling with unemployment,” General Bôas wrote in an email.
“Even as the military has been called to act in different areas, sometimes for lengthy periods,” he added, “we don’t observe considerable changes due to lack of engagement by government agencies responsible for other areas.”
After Brazil was selected to host the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, officials adopted an ambitious plan to transform poor districts that had long been hubs for drug gangs by adopting a community policing model that was supposed to pave the way for better schools, sanitation, health care and jobs.
Those plans fell short amid pervasive corruption, and Brazil entered a long recession that left the state of Rio de Janeiro bankrupt.
General Bôas also warned that permanently deploying military personnel to the front lines of Rio’s drug wars increased the risk that soldiers might become complicit in organized crime.
“These criminal structures, especially those linked to drug trafficking with international ties, make it far more likely that institutions will become tainted,” he said in his email. “There’s a possibility that troops could become tainted.”
In Mexico, the use of the military to fight organized crime has produced mixed results. Since 2006, when Felipe Calderón, then the president, first authorized the use of the military, more than 200,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence, according to official statistics, prompting the United Nations to declare that “there is an urgent need to decrease the involvement of the military in policing.”
In Rio, as the police have lost control of large areas, well-armed drug gangs have acted as the de facto authority in several teeming communities known as favelas. Critics accuse the police of using heavy-handed tactics, limiting their effectiveness, and say some members of the force have colluded with criminal organizations.
For Rita de Cassia Santos de Silva, a 53-year-old street cleaner, the military would be an improvement over the police.
“I’m afraid of the police,” she said. “They go in and take whatever they want. I think people really only obey the army.”
But Raquel da Silva, a newspaper vendor, said she did not have high expectations. “The situation is out of control,” she said. “People are getting killed for a cellphone. But it’s not up to the police or the army — the problem lies much higher up. For us in poor communities, it’s just going to get worse.”
This is the first time such a decree has been issued since the Constitution was formed in 1988, at the end of Brazil’s military dictatorship, although the armed forces have become something of a fixture in Rio. They have been called in to support the police during special events like the Summer Olympics in 2016, when more than 80,000 officers, soldiers, traffic officers and firefighters provided security for the Games.
“We have seen the effect of using military to police Rio,” said Jurema Werneck, executive director of Amnesty International Brazil. “There was a significant increase in human rights violations, especially in the case of young black men.”
Under the Constitution, military intervention in a state can be decreed for a number of reasons, including when a foreign country invades Brazil, when the government wants to prevent secession or when there is a “serious” threat to public order.
Over the past few days, Brazilian television stations have broadcast images of bloody shootouts in the city’s favelas, and of Carnival tourists being chased down Ipanema Beach and beaten by robbers.
Governor Pezão acknowledged that the deployment of 17,000 police officers was not enough. “We weren’t prepared,” he told TV Globo.
The decree will be sent to Congress and requires approval by a simple majority in both houses within 10 days before it can be implemented. According to news media reports, the armed forces will be in charge of security until Dec. 31.

But the mood didn’t look so upbeat in Rio de Janeiro, where millions took to the streets for the bacchanalia to dance their grievances away.
Yes, revellers danced at blocos, or block parties, mocking or supporting politicians. But among the glitter, the drums and tambours, the smiley faces and nipple tassels, the bullets were flying in poor areas of the cidade maravilhosa. The samba schools competed against each other in the sambadrome, featuring victims of stray bullets, armed gangs and, of course, corrupt politicians depicted as wolves in sheep’s clothing with bills falling out of their pockets.
A drummer who lives for drumming grumbled he couldn’t play in his hometown of Cidade de Deus, a sprawling tough area in Rio’s western suburbs, because gang infighting is now ferocious. “The situation today is catastrophic, it’s a war,” an acquaintance who works with gangs in the favelas said. “There used to be a time when violence paused during carnival, now it is not.” The images of violence are “unacceptable”, charged the defence minister. Amid this violence, Brazil’s military on Friday took control of public security in the state of Rio de Janeiro.
Reports of shootings topped 317 since the beginning of the month, said Fogo Cruzado, a group tracking armed violence in Rio. Three policemen were reportedly killed. Drug gang violence has increased because of a dispute between criminal factions and a fight for market share, analysts say.
Earlier, strolling with an escort in the hillside favelas, I spotted pockets of young gang members brandishing semi-automatic rifles. I have been flanked by guerrillas in Colombia and welcomed at gunpoint by , but this felt much more unnerving. Political weakness, the product of a stream of corruption scandals, has created a vacuum and the criminal gangs seem to be trying to fill it. Rio feels like a microcosm of Brazil's most serious problems.
There is a general disenchantment with the political class, reflected in representations of the unpopular President Michel Temer dressed as a vampire in the streets of Rio. Corruption scandals and violence in Rio are hardening public attitudes on law and order, providing traction to candidates likeJair Bolsonaro, a rightwing congressman and former army captain who thinks gun ownership should be widespread.
In São Paulo, sympathy towards him was evident when revellers unveiled a block party themed after the police intelligence agency that tortured dissidents during Brazil's 1964-85 military dictatorship. A recent poll by Datafolha showed Bolsonarotrailing only behind Lula. Meanwhile, in a block party in Rio, Lula supporters gyrated to the tune “where’s the legal proof?”, claiming a court ruling for graft was part of a ploy to stop the former president from winning a third term.
One night, amid “pre-carnival” celebrations I listened to the lyrics of Chico Buarque. The turquoise-eyed leftist troubadour is a sort of tropical Bob Dylan who over decades has created a musical heritage that still resonates — critics say — among the carioca gauche caviar, or Rio’s champagne left. Inevitably, there were deafening choruses of “Olé, Olá, Lula” expressing support for the former trade unionist, who once was Brazil's most popular politician.
Afterwards, in a taxi, the driver argued bandido bom é bandido morto while singing the praises of Bolsonaro. As the summer breeze wafted through the window, I closed my eyes, recalling what my favela acquaintance said: “Violence in Rio is a colossal problem exerting enormous pressure on the people.”
Only if the fog of Rio’s war dissipates do Brazil’s problems have a chance of being addressed after this election, and the next carnival will perhaps be (more) peaceful.

425,2002592035,"The Washington Post ; Washington, D.C. [Washington, D.C]17 Feb 2018: A.9.","
","The Washington Post; Washington, D.C.","Feb 17, 2018","United States, Washington, D.C.",Newspapers,News,Brazil Rio de Janeiro Brazil,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/2002592035?accountid=4840,Olympic games; Local elections; Dictators; Professional soccer; Intervention; Violence; Governors; Murders & murder attempts,General Interest Periodicals--United States,"SAO PAULO, Brazil - Brazil's military will take over security in Rio de Janeiro after a spike in violence tainted the city's Carnival celebration, President Michel Temer announced Friday.
The military intervention, the first of its kind since the end of Brazil's military dictatorship in 1988, will be in effect until December. Brazil's Congress is expected to ratify the measure early next week.
In a televised speech, Temer labeled the intervention an ""extreme measure"" necessary to crack down on organized crime and drug trafficking that have overtaken the city of 6.5 million people, the country's second-most populous.
""Enough,"" he declared. ""We won't allow them to kill our present and assassinate our future.""
Rio's secretary of security resigned after the announcement. Gen. Walter Souza Braga Netto, who coordinated security in Rio during the 2016 Summer Olympics, will be at the helm of the intervention.
Infamous for its spells of violence, Rio saw a four-year respite in homicides at the start of the decade. But as Brazil sank into its worst recession on record, the city's police budget dried up, and areas that were once heavily policed were left to the mercy of warring gangs.
The surge in crime has had serious repercussions for residents. In the past year, homicides, assaults and thefts in the city have spiked to levels not seen in 15 years. Nearly 400 schools canceled classes at various times last year because of violence, and 70 percent of the city's residents have contemplated moving to escape the situation, according to a 2017 poll.
The chaos came to a head this week when gunfire, assaults on tourists and mass muggings marred the city's largest event, Carnival. Rio's mayor and the state governor were widely criticized for skipping town as 6 million people gathered for the week-long party that has become synonymous with the city.
""The failure to restore public security is due in part to a fundamental lack of leadership from the state governor and the mayor. They have shown no interest or appetite to mount a serious response,"" Robert Muggah, director of the Igarapé Institute, a Rio-based think tank that specializes in security issues, told The Washington Post. ""The [state's] disastrous handling of public security during this year's Carnival is symptomatic of deep, systematic neglect,"" he said.
Luiz Fernando Pezão, governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro, told local media that the state miscalculated the amount of policing the city would require during the holiday.
""We were not prepared,"" he said.
Violence is on the rise in Brazil as a whole; the national murder rate ranks among the dozen highest in the world.
Security woes have propelled tough-on-crime candidates, such as former military officer Jair Bolsonaro, to the fore in this year's presidential race. Temer's deeply unpopular government hopes the military intervention in Rio will address voter concerns about violence ahead of the October elections.
Residents of Rio are used to soldiers patrolling their streets. The measure would mark the 13th time that the city has called for the military to help with chronic security issues. But past interventions were widely limited to special events, notably the Olympics and the 2014 soccer World Cup.
For many, the military takeover brings back unwelcome reminders of Brazil's dictatorship - the last time the military was in charge of the day-to-day operations of Rio's security forces. Gen. Eduardo Villas Bôas, the head of the army, criticized the increased use of military intervention to quell security crises throughout Brazil.
""Public security needs to be a priority of the states,"" he tweeted in December.
While the details of the intervention have yet to be hashed out, the government hopes that a heftier budget and access to national resources will help get the city under control.
""Residents will see a more robust security system, with a larger operational capacity and more integrated intelligence,"" said Defense Minister Raul Jungmann. ""We hope that people will feel safer.""

While the military will take control of security, Gov. Luiz Fernando Pezão will continue to run the state government of Rio de Janeiro.""This decision is motivated more by politics than sound public administration,"" said Kennedy Alencar, a political commentator and blogger in Brasília, Brazil's capital. ""Now the focus of news will be on the president's federal intervention to address an issue that concerns the whole country.""The decision was made two days after the end of Carnival, when about 1.5 million tourists descended on Rio, Brazil's second-largest city, for the annual parades and partying. But this year the festivities were marred by mass robberies, the looting of stores and shootouts between the police and drug gangs.The decree confers broad authority on the military to restore order. It also places police forces, which have had shortages of personnel and equipment, under the command of a general, Walter Souza Braga Netto, who oversees military operations in the eastern part of the country.""Together, the police and the armed forces will combat and confront those who have kidnapped our cities,"" Mr. Temer said at the signing ceremony in Brasília. ""Prison cells will no longer be thieves' personal offices. Public squares will no longer be the reception halls for organized crime.""Experts questioned the timing and motivation of the decision. It comes as Mr. Temer, who took office after his predecessor was impeached in 2016, has been weighing whether he has a chance of being elected president in October, despite his single-digit approval numbers.According to a poll last month, 38 percent of Brazilians said public security was a major concern as they considered whom to vote for. In Rio de Janeiro, violent crime, after gradually declining for almost a decade, has surged in the past two years.In 2017, there were 6,731 violent deaths in the state of Rio, or 40 per 100,000 residents -- the highest level in eight years. Carjackings, robberies of cellphones and kidnappings also increased.The decree not only shows Mr. Temer being tough on crime, it also delays a vote on an unpopular legislative proposal on pensions that looked increasingly doomed to failure. Under the Constitution, Brazilian lawmakers are barred from making broad legal changes during a military intervention imposed by decree.""On the political level, Temer might be killing two birds with one stone,"" said Christopher Harig, an expert on civilian-military relations in Brazil at King's College London. ""At the same time he creates an excuse for not being able to pass the social security reform.""Mr. Temer, who announced that he would travel to Rio on Saturday for a meeting on security, insisted that the pension overhaul could still be voted on by temporarily lifting the decree.Brazil's military leaders have expressed deep concern as the federal government has increasingly turned to the armed forces to quell outbreaks of violence around the country.Gen. Eduardo Villas Bôas, the country's top military commander, said recently that the armed forces could not be expected to solve a security crisis rooted in longstanding problems that other government agencies had failed to meaningfully address.""Combating organized crime requires effective action by the government in economic and social spheres, in order to make drug trafficking less appealing in areas where a large segment of the population is grappling with unemployment,"" General Bôas wrote in an email.""Even as the military has been called to act in different areas, sometimes for lengthy periods,"" he added, ""we don't observe considerable changes due to lack of engagement by government agencies responsible for other areas.""After Brazil was selected to host the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, officials adopted an ambitious plan to transform poor districts that had long been hubs for drug gangs by adopting a community policing model that was supposed to pave the way for better schools, sanitation, health care and jobs.Those plans fell short amid pervasive corruption, and Brazil entered a long recession that left the state of Rio de Janeiro bankrupt.General Bôas also warned that permanently deploying military personnel to the front lines of Rio's drug wars increased the risk that soldiers might become complicit in organized crime.""These criminal structures, especially those linked to drug trafficking with international ties, make it far more likely that institutions will become tainted,"" he said in his email. ""There's a possibility that troops could become tainted.""In Mexico, the use of the military to fight organized crime has produced mixed results. Since 2006, when Felipe Calderón, then the president, first authorized the use of the military, more than 200,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence, according to official statistics, prompting the United Nations to declare that ""there is an urgent need to decrease the involvement of the military in policing.""In Rio, as the police have lost control of large areas, well-armed drug gangs have acted as the de facto authority in several teeming communities known as favelas. Critics accuse the police of using heavy-handed tactics, limiting their effectiveness, and say some members of the force have colluded with criminal organizations.For Rita de Cassia Santos de Silva, a 53-year-old street cleaner, the military would be an improvement over the police.""I'm afraid of the police,"" she said. ""They go in and take whatever they want. I think people really only obey the army.""But Raquel da Silva, a newspaper vendor, said she did not have high expectations. ""The situation is out of control,"" she said. ""People are getting killed for a cellphone. But it's not up to the police or the army -- the problem lies much higher up. For us in poor communities, it's just going to get worse.""This is the first time such a decree has been issued since the Constitution was formed in 1988, at the end of Brazil's military dictatorship, although the armed forces have become something of a fixture in Rio. They have been called in to support the police during special events like the Summer Olympics in 2016, when more than 80,000 officers, soldiers, traffic officers and firefighters provided security for the Games.""We have seen the effect of using military to police Rio,"" said Jurema Werneck, executive director of Amnesty International Brazil. ""There was a significant increase in human rights violations, especially in the case of young black men.""Under the Constitution, military intervention in a state can be decreed for a number of reasons, including when a foreign country invades Brazil, when the government wants to prevent secession or when there is a ""serious"" threat to public order.Over the past few days, Brazilian television stations have broadcast images of bloody shootouts in the city's favelas, and of Carnival tourists being chased down Ipanema Beach and beaten by robbers.Governor Pezão acknowledged that the deployment of 17,000 police officers was not enough. ""We weren't prepared,"" he told TV Globo.The decree will be sent to Congress and requires approval by a simple majority in both houses within 10 days before it can be implemented. According to news media reports, the armed forces will be in charge of security until Dec. 31.Credit: ERNESTO LONDOÑO and SHASTA DARLINGTON; Ernesto Londoño reported from Rio de Janeiro, and Shasta Darlington from São Paulo, Brazil.

The military intervention, the first of its kind since the end of Brazil's military dictatorship in 1988, will be in effect until December. Brazil's Congress is expected to ratify the measure next week. 
In a televised speech, Temer labeled the intervention an ""extreme measure"" necessary to crack down on organized crime and drug trafficking that have overtaken the city of 6.5 million people, the country's second most populous.
""Enough,"" he declared. ""We won't allow them to kill our present and assassinate our future.""
Rio's secretary of security resigned following the announcement. Gen. Walter Souza Braga Netto, who coordinated security in Rio during the 2016 Summer Olympics, will be at the helm of the intervention.
Infamous for its spells of violence, Rio enjoyed a four-year respite in homicides at the start of the decade. But as Brazil sank into its worst recession on record, the city's police budget dried up, leaving areas that were once heavily policed at the mercy of warring gangs.
The surge in crime has had serious repercussions for residents. In the past year, homicides, assaults and thefts in the city spiked to levels not seen in 15 years. Nearly 400 schools canceled classes because of violence last year, and 70 percent of the city's residents have contemplated moving.
The chaos came to a head this week when gunfire, assaults on tourists and mass muggings marred the city's largest event, Carnival. Both Rio's mayor and the state governor were widely criticized for skipping town, as 6 million people gathered for the weeklong party that has become synonymous with the city. 
""The failure to restore public security is due in part to a fundamental lack of leadership from the state governor and the mayor. They have shown no interest or appetite to mount a serious response,"" Robert Muggah, director of the Igarape Institute, a Rio-based think tank that specializes in security issues, told The Washington Post. ""The (state's) disastrous handling of public security during this year's Carnival is symptomatic of deep, systematic neglect."" 
Luiz Fernando Pezao, governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro, told local media that the state miscalculated the amount of policing the city would require during the holiday. ""We were not prepared,"" he said. 
Violence is on the rise in Brazil as a whole. Security woes have propelled tough-on-crime candidates, such as former military officer Jair Bolsonaro, to the fore in this year's presidential race. Temer's deeply unpopular government hopes the military intervention in Rio will address voter concerns about violence ahead of the October elections. 
Residents of Rio are used to soldiers patrolling their streets. The measure would mark the 13th time that the city has called for the military to help with chronic security issues.

The military intervention, the first of its kind since the end of Brazil's military dictatorship in 1988, will be in effect until December. Brazil's Congress is expected to ratify the measure next week. 
In a televised speech, Temer labeled the intervention an ""extreme measure"" necessary to crack down on organized crime and drug trafficking that have overtaken the city of 6.5 million people, the country's second most populous.
""Enough,"" he declared. ""We won't allow them to kill our present and assassinate our future.""
Rio's secretary of security resigned following the announcement. Gen. Walter Souza Braga Netto, who coordinated security in Rio during the 2016 Summer Olympics, will be at the helm of the intervention.
Infamous for its spells of violence, Rio enjoyed a four-year respite in homicides at the start of the decade. But as Brazil sank into its worst recession on record, the city's police budget dried up, leaving areas that were once heavily policed at the mercy of warring gangs.
The surge in crime has had serious repercussions for residents. In the past year, homicides, assaults and thefts in the city spiked to levels not seen in 15 years. Nearly 400 schools canceled classes because of violence last year, and 70 percent of the city's residents have contemplated moving.
The chaos came to a head this week when gunfire, assaults on tourists and mass muggings marred the city's largest event, Carnival. Both Rio's mayor and the state governor were widely criticized for skipping town, as 6 million people gathered for the weeklong party that has become synonymous with the city.

433,2002663693,"France 24 , English ed.; Paris   Paris: SyndiGate Media Inc. (Feb 17, 2018)","Brazilian President Michel Temer signed a decree on Friday handing the military full control of security in Rio de Janeiro, in the wake of a rise in crime and violence in the state.","France 24, English ed.; Paris","Feb 17, 2018","United States, Paris",Other Sources,News,Brazil Rio de Janeiro Brazil,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/2002663693?accountid=4840,Organized crime; Violence; Local elections; Robbery; Murders & murder attempts,General Interest Periodicals--France,"Brazilian President Michel Temer signed a decree on Friday handing the military full control of security in Rio de Janeiro, in the wake of a rise in crime and violence in the state.
The measure comes after Rio de Janeiro's famous annual carnival, which is considered the biggest carnival in the world, was marred by violence this week. In their Wednesday programming, broadcast network TV Globo showed videos of fighting between rival gangs and tourists being punched and falling victim to armed robberies.
Rio State Governor Luiz Fernando Pezao was forced to apologise in response to the images, saying that the 17,000 police officers who were deployed were not enough. ""We were not ready,"" he told media. ""There were mistakes in the first days and we reinforced the patrols.""
However, Joana Monteiro, the chief executive of Rio's Security Institute, said that early data suggests that the 2018 festival was not necessarily more violent than previous years. This year, 5,865 incidents were reported by the police during Carnival week, including 86 homicides, more than 1,000 instances of pickpocketing, and 262 seizures of drugs. Last year there were 5,773 reported incidents.
This has not stopped President Temer from acting to crack down on the criminal violence across the city.
""I am taking these extreme measures because circumstances demand it,"" Temer said after signing the decree to combat seemingly endless waves of gang-driven violence. Congress is expected to ratify it within 10 days.
""The government will give tough and firm answers, taking all necessary measures to eradicate organised crime,"" he added.
He described organised crime as ""a metastasis that spreads through the country and threatens the tranquillity of our people.""
Army patrols are already used in Rio's gang-ruled favelas, but this decree will now give the military full control of security operations in Rio state, including authority over state police. This is the first time the country has taken such a step since its return to democracy in 1985, after two decades of military rule.
Defense Minister Raul Jungmann declared last month that ""the security system is broken,"" but in the same speech specified that the army would not replace the police on the ground, but instead provide logistical support in their fight against the drug lords.
Military reinforcements ... for political gain

But some think that the move is driven by political motivations.
A measure like this is considered a ""federal intervention"" in the eyes of the law, and amendments to the constitution cannot be made while a federal intervention is underway. This conveniently lets Temer off the hook from pushing through a vote on an unpopular pension reform that could damage his public reputation even further. The reform needs 308 votes to pass, and it is expected that Temer's government can only scrape together around 270. Temer is unwilling to suffer such a defeat with the general election coming up in October this year.
With his approval rating currently in single figures and general elections on the horizon, Temer is keen to avoid unpopular public policy. A poll last month showed that 38 per cent of Brazilians said public security was a major concern in whom they would vote for. Temer taking a tough-on-crime attitude would play well with voters.
Responsibility for security in Rio will now fall to General Walter Souza Braga Neto, who was the man in charge of coordinating security when the city hosted the 2016 Olympic Games.
The army's mission will last until the end of Temer's term as president, December 31.

President Michel Temer, who signed the decree on Friday that will be in place until the end of the year, called it an “extreme measure”. “You know that organised crime has almost taken over the state of Rio de Janeiro,” Mr Temer said in a televised speech. “It is a metastasis that spreads around the country.”
Roberto Sá, Rio state’s secretary of security, resigned after the announcement, and General Walter Souza Braga, who co-ordinated security during the city’s 2016 Olympics, will be in charge of the intervention.
Rio is facing a sharp deterioration in public security, with levels of homicide, assault, and theft in 2017 and early 2018 reaching levels not seen in more than a decade. Ahead of uncertain presidential elections in October, opinion polls show that security is a top priority and there is a sense that criminal violence is spinning out of control.
This concern was highlighted during the carnival parades this week, whensamba schoolsfeatured victims of stray bullets, armed gangs, and even a child’s coffin after a three-year-old girl was killed in an attempted robbery.
Shoot-outs are increasingly common in the city’s vast favelas, having topped 317 since the beginning of the month, said Fogo Cruzado, a group tracking armed violence. Residents and gang members blame police brutality for the growing violence, while others say the stumbling economy has been forcing Brazil’s dominant criminal factions to fight for a share of the drugs market.
“There used to be a time when violence paused during carnival,” said José Pereira de Oliveira of Afroreggae, an organisation working in the favelas rehabilitating gang members. Luiz Fernando Pezão, the governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro, admitted that policing efforts during a holiday in which more than 6m revellers take to the streets, were insufficient. “We were not prepared,” he told Globo.
Acorruption scandalcentred onPetrobras, the state-owned oil company based in Rio, and falling oil prices have nearly bankrupted the state government, leading to cuts in security budgets. Meanwhile, former state governors and businessmen have been jailed for corruption. Many saycriminal gangsare taking advantage of such political paralysis.
“There was a palatable sense of insecurity in Rio over the past month, especially during carnival,” said Robert Muggah of security think-tank Igarapé Institute. With Mr Temer’s popularity in single-digits, “a ‘tough on crime’ approach plays well with the public, and bolsters the credentials of like-minded presidential and state-level candidates.”
Maurício Santoro, a political scientist with Rio de Janeiro State University, believed that the measure “has a wider repercussion for the presidential election itself, for national politics”, as the security situation could well play into the hands ofJair Bolsonaro, a rightwing politician and former army captain, who is running second in opinion polls.
Analysts also believe the security decree, which is expected to be ratified by Congress early next week, was driven by other political calculations. With general elections approaching, legislators want to avoid an unpopular overhaul of thepensions system, that economists and investors see as crucial to Brazil’s long-term fiscal prosperity.
This requires 308 votes as it would require an amendment to the constitution. But congressional insiders say the government has between 270-280 votes and Mr Temer would not risk defeat before securing the votes needed. Lawmakers were expected to discuss the pension reform soon, but “the constitution has a rule that prevents amendments to it while a federal intervention is in force”, like in Rio, said Oscar Vilhena of the FGV Direito law school. “My interpretation is that they can continue handling it, but it can not be approved.”
Mr Muggah of Igarapé Institute added: “Real security concerns in Rio de Janeiro and real politicking in Brasília are shaping the decision to put the military in charge of public security.
“It is the equivalent of a public policy ‘Hail Mary’ and the results are far from certain.”

The military intervention, the first of its kind since the end of Brazil's military dictatorship in 1988, will be in effect until December. Brazil's Congress is expected to ratify the measure next week.In a televised speech, Temer labeled the intervention an ""extreme measure"" necessary to crack down on organized crime and drug trafficking that have overtaken the city of 6.5 million people, the country's second most populous.""Enough,"" he declared. ""We won't allow them to kill our present and assassinate our future.""Rio's secretary of security resigned following the announcement. Gen. Walter Souza Braga Netto, who coordinated security in Rio during the 2016 Summer Olympics, will be at the helm of the intervention.Infamous for its spells of violence, Rio enjoyed a four-year respite in homicides at the start of the decade. But as Brazil sank into its worst recession on record, the city's police budget dried up, leaving areas that were once heavily policed at the mercy of warring gangs.The surge in crime has had serious repercussions for residents. In the past year, homicides, assaults and thefts in the city spiked to levels not seen in 15 years. Nearly 400 schools canceled classes because of violence last year, and 70 percent of the city's residents have contemplated moving.The chaos came to a head this week when gunfire, assaults on tourists and mass muggings marred the city's largest event, Carnival. Both Rio's mayor and the state governor were widely criticized for skipping town, as 6 million people gathered for the weeklong party that has become synonymous with the city.""The failure to restore public security is due in part to a fundamental lack of leadership from the state governor and the mayor. They have shown no interest or appetite to mount a serious response,"" Robert Muggah, director of the Igarape Institute, a Rio-based think tank that specializes in security issues, told The Washington Post. ""The (state's) disastrous handling of public security during this year's Carnival is symptomatic of deep, systematic neglect.""Luiz Fernando Pezao, governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro, told local media that the state miscalculated the amount of policing the city would require during the holiday. ""We were not prepared,"" he said.Violence is on the rise in Brazil as a whole. Security woes have propelled tough-on-crime candidates, such as former military officer Jair Bolsonaro, to the fore in this year's presidential race. Temer's deeply unpopular government hopes the military intervention in Rio will address voter concerns about violence ahead of the October elections.Residents of Rio are used to soldiers patrolling their streets. The measure would mark the 13th time that the city has called for the military to help with chronic security issues.CAPTION: Photo: Brazil's government is putting Rio de Janiero's police force under military control after a spike in violence.

 The hit by Jordana Gleise de Jesus Menezes - known as JoJo Todynho - has spawned myriad parody videos on YouTube since it was released in December.
 The clips often show children and adults collapsing to the ground as a shot rings out following the lyrics ""What a shot,"" before the person stands up and begins to dance as the music picks up.
 The spoofs have revived debate about whether the popular dance music genre from Rio de Janeiro, known as funk, glamorizes violence. On Friday, Brazil's government ordered the army to take over command of police forces in Rio de Janeiro state to curb violence after killings increased by nearly 8 percent last year to 6,731.
 A petition to outlaw funk music because of its explicit treatment of violence, sex and drugs gained more than 20,000 signatures last year but has failed to gain traction in Congress. In a population of around 210 million people, the government recorded 59,080 gun deaths in 2015, putting it in the top 10 World Bank list of the most murderous countries.
 In a music video featuring images of coffins and the faces of young children killed by stray bullets in Rio, rapper Gabriel O Pensador, also from Rio, Brazil's second-largest city, objected to the parodies.
 ""What a shot? No, I'm not going to fall to the floor ... I'm a joker too, but joking has a time and a place,"" he raps. ""The Rio that we love celebrates carnival and this violence is terrifying.""
 A city in the northeastern state of Alagoas tried to ban the song being played during Carnival this month, arguing it incited violence. Authorities sought to impose a fine of 2,000 reais ($616) for each violation, but a court stopped the city from punishing musicians before a final ruling is reached, media reports said.
 Todynho, 21, whose artistic name refers to a popular brand of chocolate milk, is from Rio's tough western neighborhood of Bangu. She said the phrase is used to mean ""how cool,"" in a song mostly about sambaing with your girlfriends.
 The official music video, with over 136 million views, made the rounds as national attention was focused on violence during the Carnival festivities in Rio, with images of gangs robbing tourists en masse repeatedly broadcast on national TV.
 Performers of funk music often say they are only reflecting the harsh reality of Rio de Janeiro and the country at large.
 The music has also been toned down as it has moved from the favelas to the mainstream. Todynho herself has lashed back at her detractors.
 ""First of all, don't talk about what you haven't lived through,"" she said on Instagram, referring to rampant violence in the shanty towns of the city of six million people.

Brazilian President Michel Temer ordered military control of Rio de Janeiro on Feb. 16, just days after the city’s famous Carnival celebration was tainted by an increase in crime and violence in the area, according to The Washington Post.

The mandate, which will expire in December, gives extensive control to the Brazilian military with the goal of reestablishing security. Command of police forces was given to General Walter Souza Barag Netto, who coordinated security in Rio at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, according to The Washington Post.

Carnival, the city’s largest and most culturally identifying event, was the scene of muggings, assaults on tourists and drug trafficking. According to The Washington Post, violent crime in the city has reached a 15-year high.

At the signing ceremony, Temer reassured the public that the military and police will work together to reclaim the city, which has a population of 6.5 million.

“Together, the police and armed forces will combat and confront those who have kidnapped our cities,” Temer said, according to The New York Times. “Prison cells will no longer be thieves’ personal offices. Public squares will no longer be the reception halls for organized crime.”

There has not been federal military intervention in state affairs in Brazil since the nation ended its 21-year long military dictatorship in 1985. Brazil’s congress approved Temer’s orders on Feb. 20, according to ABC News.

The order comes at a time of economic crisis. The country has been in a deep economic recession in the last decade, and Rio’s police budget began to dwindle as the city went bankrupt. Areas that were previously heavily policed were overtaken by organized crime and gang violence, according to The Washington Post.

The public’s response to the military intervention has been mixed. Some believe military intervention would benefit the city, while other residents are unsure if their involvement will bring permanent change. Given the upcoming presidential elections, some are especially suspicious of the order being used as a means of increasing Temer’s reputation, according to BBC.  

“I’m afraid of the police,” said Rita de Cassia Santos de Silva, a 53-year-old Rio native, according to The New York Times. “They go in and take whatever they want. I think people really only obey the army.”

Despite skepticism from the public, Temer aims to eradicate Rio’s position as one of the most dangerous cities in the world.

“We were not ready. There were mistakes in the first days and we reinforced the patrols,” Temer said, according to BBC. “The government will give tough and firm answers, taking all necessary measures to eradicate organized crime.”

The family-friendly event featured live Brazilian bands, arts and crafts for kids, food vendors, samba dancers, and of course, the great beer Novo Brazil has become known for.
Novo Brazil founding partner and brewer Eduardo Pentagna spoke with La Prensa San Diego about the event and the new beers joining their award-winning taplist.
""The idea is to show Americans a little bit of our Brazilian culture and who we are proud to be,"" said Pentagna. ""We are an American brewery run by Brazilians, and we want to show to everyone the love from Brazil.""
Some of that love from Brazil comes in the form of the coconut lager, a special brew made exclusively for Saturday's carnival.
""We have a lot of coconuts in Brazil, so we wanted to make this beer,"" said Pentagna. ""It has some sweet notes and its refreshing.""
Other new arrivals were the Novo Kings Hazy IPA, a collaboration with Rancho Cucamonga-based King's Brewing, Jobim Double IPA, and a new batch of last year's smash hit Pool Party IPA.
Novo Brazil also officially unveiled its new toucan logos and updated image as a part of the celebration.
""We wanted to show off our new branding today,"" Pentagna said. ""We are evolving, we are growing with Chula Vista, but most importantly, we just wanna have fun.""

488,2013071871,"Florida Times Union ; Jacksonville, Fla. [Jacksonville, Fla]07 Mar 2018: 1.","Thanks to the vast reach of social media and the prevalence of sexual misconduct in virtually every society, the #MeToo movement has proven itself a genuinely global phenomenon. Yet its impact varies widely from country to country, from potentially momentous to inconsequential.No other nation has experienced anything close to the developments in the United States, the movements birthplace, where scores of prominent men -- among them politicians, media stars and movie moguls -- have lost jobs and reputations after facing sexual misconduct allegations.As the global womens movement prepares for International Womens Day on Thursday, its clear the record elsewhere is mixed.In Western Europe, some VIPs have been discredited and some new anti-harassment laws are in the works. Worldwide, the fallout includes backlashes against women who speak out, divisions within feminist ranks and minimal repercussions for accused harassers. And in many countries, the U.S. included, the movement has consisted primarily of well-educated professionals, largely leaving out working-class and poor women. Some skeptics have coined the hashtag #WeFew.In some countries where the movement hasnt caught fire, analysts have suggested that resistance to American cultural trends is among the factors.I wish it hadnt started in the U.S., said Anne Marie Goetz, a professor of global affairs at New York University and a former United Nations adviser on womens issues.The fastest way to discredit any womens rights struggle is to say it comes from somewhere else, Goetz said. Thats been a longstanding putdown of feminist movements all around the world.In China, discussion of #MeToo has sometimes been censored on social media and branded as a destabilizing foreign movement. To thwart the censors, social media users have made creative use of hashtags such as #RiceBunny -- a phrase which in China is pronounced me too.The hashtags, and womens accounts of harassment, proliferated in January after Luo Xixi, an academic now based in the U.S., accused a renowned Beijing-based professor of sexual misconduct when she was a graduate student. Other women lodged similar allegations, and the professor was fired. But questions linger as to whether a feminist movement can gain greater clout in the face of government resistance.In India, sexual misconduct allegations against more than 60 academics sparked divisions among feminists. A crowdsourced list of alleged harassers was posted on Facebook by a U.S.-based law student, with contributions from students in India. But the list contained few details about the allegations or accusers, and was criticized by some women as unfair.India passed a law in 2013 to combat workplace sexual harassment, but gender-equality activist Sudarshana Kundu said many women remain hesitant to speak up.There is culture of silencing that is prevalent, she said by email. Organizations are worried about their credibility and counsel their women employees to not report instances and instead seek conciliation.Perhaps no country has had a more complex reaction to #MeToo than France, long identified as a haven for romance. The government is preparing new legislation on sexual violence and harassment, and some lawmakers want to impose fines for sexist catcalls. Yet despite sexual misconduct allegations against several prominent men, they have maintained their jobs and status. French feminist ranks, meanwhile, have experienced divisions, notably when actress Catherine Deneuve co-signed a letter depicting #MeToo accusers as puritanical, only to apologize after facing a backlash.In Britain, organizers decided to discontinue an annual men-only charity gala after a Financial Times investigation found that female hostesses, required to wear short skirts and high heels, were groped by some of the hundreds of senior executives who attended the event in January.It is quite extraordinary to me that in the 21st century allegations of this kind are emerging, Education Minister Anne Milton told the House of Commons. Women have the right to feel safe wherever they work.Harassment allegations last year led to one high-level resignation, of Defense Secretary Michael Fallon, and prompted political leaders to propose a new grievance procedure for people working in Parliament.Even in Nordic countries ranked high for gender equality, there has been #MeToo turmoil. In Iceland and Sweden, women in numerous professional sectors mounted social media campaigns to raise awareness about widespread sexual misconduct; the Swedish government has proposed tightening its rape law to stipulate that explicit consent is required before sexual contact.In many parts of the world, including Africa and much of Latin America, the #MeToo movement has had only modest impact. Many countries in those regions have weak support systems for women who do report sexual assault.Many Brazilian women chose to push back against sexual harassment during this years Carnival celebrations, with block parties of all-female musicians, plus shirts, necklaces and crowns with messages like my breasts, my rules, and several anti-harassment campaigns. But overall, the movement has not caught on in Brazil, which has one of the worlds highest homicide rates for women.In South Africa, also plagued by a high rate of violence against women, feminists are frustrated by the almost total lack of repercussions for prominent men linked to sexual misconduct.We need more hashtags and awareness, but more importantly we need action and accountability, wrote Shaazia Ebrahim in an opinion piece. If we continue to allow sexism on the highest platforms in South Africa, we shouldnt be shocked about our gender-based violence statistics.The fatalism of some South African women was reflected in recent interviews conducted by Norwegian student activists working in Johannesburg.Sebatso Mafisa, 24, said many South African men did not consider groping to be wrong.Its the culture, she said. Theres nothing you as a woman can do about it.Anne Marie Goetz, the NYU professor, said #MeToos future may depend on how effectively it surmounts dividing lines.Its about solidarity across all kinds of boundaries -- rich or poor, black or white, North or South, she said. If you get an explosion of #MeToo, you start getting the protection of numbers, and a growing mass of evidence that theres a real problem -- not just one individual making this up.Cynthia Enloe, who teaches gender studies at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, and works with feminists in many countries, is convinced that #MeToo will have staying power as more women in developing nations gain formal employment.Maybe the hashtag version will fade, but not the energy behind guaranteeing womens respect in the workplace, Enloe said by phone from Iceland.

Yet its impact varies widely from country to country, from potentially momentous to inconsequential.No other nation has experienced anything close to the developments in the United States, the movements birthplace, where scores of prominent men -- among them politicians, media stars and movie moguls -- have lost jobs and reputations after facing sexual misconduct allegations.As the global womens movement prepares for International Womens Day on Thursday, its clear the record elsewhere is mixed.In Western Europe, some VIPs have been discredited and some new anti-harassment laws are in the works. Worldwide, the fallout includes backlashes against women who speak out, divisions within feminist ranks and minimal repercussions for accused harassers. And in many countries, the U.S. included, the movement has consisted primarily of well-educated professionals, largely leaving out working-class and poor women. Some skeptics have coined the hashtag #WeFew.In some countries where the movement hasnt caught fire, analysts have suggested that resistance to American cultural trends is among the factors.I wish it hadnt started in the U.S., said Anne Marie Goetz, a professor of global affairs at New York University and a former United Nations adviser on womens issues.The fastest way to discredit any womens rights struggle is to say it comes from somewhere else, Goetz said. Thats been a longstanding putdown of feminist movements all around the world.In China, discussion of #MeToo has sometimes been censored on social media and branded as a destabilizing foreign movement. To thwart the censors, social media users have made creative use of hashtags such as #RiceBunny -- a phrase which in China is pronounced me too.The hashtags, and womens accounts of harassment, proliferated in January after Luo Xixi, an academic now based in the U.S., accused a renowned Beijing-based professor of sexual misconduct when she was a graduate student. Other women lodged similar allegations, and the professor was fired. But questions linger as to whether a feminist movement can gain greater clout in the face of government resistance.In India, sexual misconduct allegations against more than 60 academics sparked divisions among feminists.

Sam Ward-Hardy, a student and musician from Crook, County Durham, will be travelling to Brazil to research Brazilian carnival arts and their communities.
The 18-year-old has been awarded about £7,000 for the trip through the Churchill Fellowships.
The prestigious scheme offers a recipients the chance to travel the world and research cutting-edge solutions to important topical issues.
And the Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College music student was officially named as a recipient by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, which runs the scheme, today.
He said: ""I'm excited. It's going to be amazing. I'm probably going to have to learn Portuguese but I will be able to share what I have learned with people when I come back.""
Mr Ward-Hardy has been playing guitar since he was about eight before developing an interest in Brazilian music after his uncle, Paddy Burton, set up a samba band at the Jack Drum Arts centre, an arts company in Crook, when he was 11.
The teenager said he plans to study religious music while visiting parts of Brazil including Rio de Janeiro, El Salvador and Sao Paulo.
While studying the music, he will also get the chance to explore the country's culture and work with young people.
He was also inspired to apply by his mum, Helen Ward, and aunty Julie Ward, who have both taken part in the scheme in the past.
He said: ""They are very proud as I'm following what they did.""
Mr Ward-Hardy plans to leave for his adventure in November and hopes to go on to study music at university.
He is one of four North-East candidates to secure a place on the scheme including Lynne Hindmarch and Allison Sykes, both from Newcastle and David Robinson, from Houghton-le-Spring.
Together they will receive grants totalling more than £25,000 and are among 150 people selected from more than 1,000 applicants.
Laura Emerson Roberts, lead arts and music worker at Jack Drum Arts, said she was ""delighted"" for the youngster who has developed into an ""exceptional musician and smashing young man"" through the centre's Youth Music programme.
She said: ""Sam is incredibly passionate about Brazilian percussion and the tremendous amount of hard-work he puts into his personal development is reflected in his growing talent. I can’t think of anyone more deserving of this opportunity and I know that Sam will make the most of it, not only for himself but for our community when he returns to share everything he has learned. Well done Sam.""
“Churchill Fellows search the world for ways to improve their communities and professions,” added Julia Weston, chief executive of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust. “This life-changing opportunity is open to everyone, with our next round of grants opening on April 27.”

That became clear when my taxi took a right turn toward the city center, and smack into what might be the most entertaining traffic jam I’ve ever experienced.
Within seconds, hundreds of revelers, many of them wearing sparkling bikinis, elaborate feather headdresses — and little else — had engulfed our car, streaming down the street in the opposite direction. One woman in a sequined, beige one-piece flashed a cheeky smile and began “ wining ” with our front bumper. (That’s a dance that typically involves a woman and man standing back-to-front and “winding” their hips against one another.)

To my left a shirtless young man was grinding up against my window, while a woman behind him smacked his rear end. I was sharing the cab with three Londoners I’d met at the airport, and the woman among them burst out laughing: “I brought way too many clothes.”
Trinidad’s Carnival is second in reputation only to Brazil’s for both beauty and debauchery. The massive, joyous street party I’d experienced upon arrival, I soon found out, was actually an off night. The real action would begin the next day, with serious celebrants in serious costumes hitting the street as early as 8 a.m. and dancing until dawn on Ash Wednesday.
“You can’t come to Trinidad and not play mas!” said Linda Wells, a Trinidad-born nurse living in Brooklyn who’s been coming back to her home country every year for 20 years to celebrate. She was using the nickname for “masquerade,” a tradition that dates back to 18th-century balls that French plantation owners used to throw (and their slaves mimicked) to let loose before the asceticism of Lent.
Ms. Wells is 56 but looks about 30 years younger, with a long blonde braid springing from the top of her head and the rest of her hair shaved off underneath. I had run into her and her girlfriends — an accountant, a bank manager, a former publicist — getting ready near Queen’s Park Savannah, where “bands,” or costumed groups, go to compete for prizes. (A shocking number of Carnival-goers I met were Trinis from New York City.)
The custom-designed dress Ms. Wells was to wear, she showed me, was flesh colored, with an intricate pattern of green sequins and a train of green feathers, and would have put everyone at the Oscars to shame. She’d be adding a “backpack” of flowing green and blue fabric, splayed out to look like a peacock’s tail that was so heavy it required the help of two young men to get it on. Then she would dance all day in it.
“I’m with the K2K band. You have to follow us. We’re going to be fabulous!” she said, and sent me down to the park under the protection of her husband, Earl Wells, a field surveyor who was wearing an antlered headdress, face paint and head-to-toe tie-dye. Soon I was in the midst of several hundred people twirling around in elaborate fabric wings, or getting down to soca music with sparkling suns on sticks attached to their backs that shot up 20 feet in the air.
Karen and Kathy Norman, Trinidad-born twin sisters living in New Jersey, designed all of the band’s costumes, and to join, all Ms. Wells had to do was sign up and pay for her costume in advance. This was her second year with K2K and she was sure she’d be back. “They’re so different. In Trinidad, you mostly see people in two-piece bikinis. But K2K, it’s about the fashion. You don’t see anyone wearing anything like that. I like the elegance, and you’re covered up! We’re old. We need it!”
Technically, Trinidad had not been on the original itinerary of the yearlong, worldwide trip I’m on for The Times, visiting each place on the 52 Places to Go in 2018 list . In an effort to convey to readers that the Caribbean, large swaths of which had been hit by two hurricanes last year, shouldn’t be avoided as a travel destination, my editors had put the entire region at No. 4. Working with data scientists from Kayak, the online booking site, we crafted an itinerary that would take me to two islands that hadn’t been affected by the hurricanes (Trinidad and St. Lucia) and one that very much had (Puerto Rico, which I’ll be writing about next week).
That lineup scratched a few itches: the desire to experience Carnival; to island hop (to me, another defining Caribbean experience); and to go somewhere that had sustained damage and see for myself what being “back open for business” really looked like. What would it mean to be a responsible visitor to such a place, and how could I both encourage tourism while accurately conveying the situation?
What followed was a visit to the Caribbean at a breakneck pace that I would advise no sane person to mimic. For complicated logistical and cost-related reasons that made sense at the time, I’d mapped out a plan with Kayak to go to St. Lucia, then to Trinidad and back, then off to San Juan — all in four days.
Traveling to Trinidad during Carnival turns out to be stressful even when you’re not on a 24-hour, please-don’t-try-this-at-home marathon. The Brits I shared my taxi with showed up only to find out that their hotel had given away their reservation (common, apparently), so they came to my place, President’s Inn , where we all encountered the surprise that the front desk only took cash. (For me, that meant a trip to an A.T.M. on a dark and isolated street. Our heroic taxi driver refused to let me go alone.) Still, as simple as our hotel was, it was in an ideal location close to the action. Just three blocks away, I found a calypso show called Pandemonium in a dirt lot and featuring incredible steel-pan players from as far away as Paris.
I had good luck finding that show, and the K2K band, while walking around, but nearly everyone I ran into seemed horrified to see me on my own. When I strayed from the show to look for something to eat, a young man raced up behind me. His name was Kadeem and he wanted to warn me that I had just narrowly escaped a robber who had been casing me, and who was blocking my way back to the show. “Be careful of that guy. He’s not a nice guy,” he said. “He won’t bother you, but he looked like he wanted to get someone at the corner.”
Later, back at the show, I befriended a female pan player named Lenitia Solomon who happened to be a police officer in another part of town. “Trinidad is not safe, especially around Carnival. A lot of phone snatchers. Believe me, I’ve seen it all. Be aware of who’s around you,” she said, before telling me the story of a Japanese pan-player friend of hers who had been murdered at last year’s Carnival. She insisted on taking me back to my hotel with a male friend who had come to walk her back to the show. Despite such warnings, Trinidad was vibrant and colorful and edgy, and I loved every minute of it.
But I also wouldn’t trade the serenity of the brief time I got to spend in St. Lucia. A volcanic island known for its twin mountains, the Pitons, it has a kind of rugged charm one doesn’t normally associate with Caribbean luxury. (It’s also the only island I got to spend any time on during my one previous visit to the Caribbean, on a friend’s sailing trip more than 10 years ago, and has always held special memories for me.) The hurricanes largely skipped the island, though Judith Verity, who owns the Mango Beach Inn , where I stayed, kept mentioning how much more beautiful her incredibly beautiful garden had been before the storm. “We are blessed people. God loves us,” said my taxi driver, Barry Augustin, of why the jungle paradise where he’s lived his whole life had been spared. “In St. Lucia, the economy is already so hard, so God protects his children.”
While I missed most of St. Lucia’s best attractions — a hike up the Pitons, the sulfur hot springs — I did get to experience some of its lush beauty. There are banana plantations everywhere. On the side of the busy Micoud highway, Mr. Augustin pulled over at a family-run roadside stand he calls the Creole Bread Place (real name: Golden Palace) that he claims makes the best baked goods on the island. A gray-bearded man named Mango was pulling spiral loaves out of a wood-fired oven with a wooden paddle, while Seco, his daughter, split them open and filled them with curried, shredded fish, and his son, Earl Joseph, who turned out to be the owner, handled the money.
Though there are far more luxurious places to stay — Mr. Augustin has a second job at one, the Ladera resort — I was charmed by Mango Beach Inn. There’s no way to get to its location, in an old building on Marigot Bay on the northwest side of the island, other than by ferry, and one day I came in to see that the maid had decorated my mosquito netting with rose petals. Down the stairs was Hassey’s Waterside Bar , which just might be the perfect vacation lounge, flush with the bay and covered in strings of lights. I met a 21-year-old beach worker named Jamal Felix, who described his job: “I put the beach lounges down, I go fishing, I climb the coconut trees, I use the swing on the coconut trees and fall in the water, I go swimming.”
I felt completely at odds with everyone else on the island, from the natives (like Mr. Felix) whose jobs included regular swim breaks, to the many couples on romantic vacations who were spending their days on hikes or boat rides. I mainly stressed out about how to squeeze in this ridiculous Trinidad idea, or sat in Mango Beach Inn’s lovely common room overlooking the bay and wrote.
As my taxi driver, Domitiana René, saw me frantically trying to post to Instagram on my way back to the airport, she told me not to worry. The island would still be there. It was blessed. It was paradise. I could always come back to check out St. Lucia’s Carnival in June and July. It was her favorite time of year. “I think we are becoming more and more like Trinidad,” she said. “Every year I’m noticing people wearing less and less clothes.”

","The Washington Post (Online); Washington, D.C.","Mar 14, 2018","United States, Washington, D.C.","Blogs, Podcasts, & Websites",News,United States--US Philippines Latin America Cuba Brazil Rio de Janeiro Brazil Austria,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/2014092461?accountid=4840,Law enforcement; Dictators; Politics; Corruption; Rape; International relations; Nostalgia; Kickbacks; Democracy; Murders & murder attempts; Millennials,General Interest Periodicals--United States,"SAO PAULO, Brazil — The military dictatorship that ruled Brazil four decades ago maintained law and order through systematic brutality. Nearly 500 people were killed or simply disappeared. But at a political rally outside Sao Paulo last week, the air was thick with nostalgia for that era of terror.
Several hundred people in army camouflage and police T-shirts shouted their admiration for the soldiers who carried out the kidnappings and murders authorized by the regime.
""Thanks to you, Brazil did not become Cuba!"" they chanted, some snapping salutes. ""Brazil first, God above all.""
The dictatorship-era generals were also accused of deploying electric shocks, beatings and psychological torture in their two-decade-long effort to cement power and ward off communism. But as a crime wave rocks some of the country's largest cities and a corruption scandal engulfs its political elite, some Brazilians see them as the last champions of public order.
""During the dictatorship, there was safety. That doesn't exist today,"" said Marcelo Freitas, a 42-year-old former army officer at the rally who said he was shot in the eye 10 years ago during a mugging. ""If we want to clean up the country, we need the military.""
On average, seven people are violently killed every hour in Brazil, according to government figures. In 2016, the country registered a record rate of 29.9 homicides for every 100,000 people, nearly six times that of the United States.
Freitas, who wore a leather patch over his blinded eye and a camouflage T-shirt, said he dreams of safer streets for his 5-year-old son and would support a return to a military regime.
He is not alone. Nostalgia for the dictatorship is growing. An estimated 43 percent of the population supports a temporary revival of military control, according to a 2017 poll, up from 35 percent in 2016. The figure is especially high among young people, many of whom say they are disillusioned with democracy and with Brazil's scandal-tainted politicians.
Brazil isn't the only country where democracy is losing its glow. In the United States, just 30 percent of people born in the 1980s say they believe it is ""essential"" to live in a democracy, as opposed to 72 percent of people born before World War II, according to a study published in the Journal of Democracy in 2016.
Fear of violence, whether it be terrorism or street crime, has fueled support for authoritarian parties and bolstered populist leaders with tough-on-crime, anti-immigrant platforms around the world, from President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines to Chancellor Sebastian Kurz in Austria.
But the flirtation with authoritarianism may be especially ominous in Brazil, where wobbly democratic institutions are still recovering from the dictatorship that held the country in its grip from 1964 to 1985.
Last month, President Michel Temer ordered the military to take over security in Rio de Janeiro after a spike in crime soured Carnival celebrations. The move was widely denounced as a dangerous precedent — although it was also seen as a smart response to the growing base of voters calling for law and order.
""This sentiment is in the air and is being exploited. The intervention in Rio is an attempt by the president to explore that feeling — the nostalgia, the feeling that the military is an anti-political, tough, external body,"" said Pablo Ortellado, a public policy professor at the University of Sao Paulo. ""Depending on how the intervention goes, if it succeeds in even appearing to reduce crime, it could generate a dangerous wave of militarism.""
For many of Brazil's millennials, disillusionment with democracy has resulted in a rejection of the leftist groups that governed Latin America for the past two decades, according to Renato Sérgio de Lima, president of the Brazilian Forum on Public Security.
""The left is the only reference that [millennials] have for political power, because it has ruled for most of their politically conscious life. That government is being destroyed by corruption, so what is the alternative?"" Lima said.
Four years into a corruption investigation that has traced a local carwash kickback scheme up to the highest echelons of government, Brazilian democracy is facing its worst legitimacy crisis since the dictatorship. The scandal has tarnished more than 100 of the country's top politicians, including the current president and two former ones, and left few viable candidates for the presidential elections in six months.
Jair Bolsonaro, an outspoken senator from a fringe party, has emerged as one of the only aspiring contenders with both charisma and a clean record. A former soldier, he became famous for challenging his rivals and the media to find proof that he has been involved in corruption.
Bolsonaro has paired his unblemished record with a tough-on-crime platform and public statements of admiration for the dictatorship era. He is not calling for a return to military dictatorship, but he has done so in the past and talks up its law-and-order values. In 2016, he eulogized the late Col. Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, a convicted torturer, as he cast his vote to impeach then-President Dilma Rousseff, who was jailed and tortured during the dictatorship.
According to the latest polls, he has the backing of 18 percent of prospective voters, trailing only former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is at 37 percent but may be barred from running because of a corruption conviction.
Bolsonaro has since made headlines for other brash statements, including calling a fellow senator not worthy of being raped and saying he could not love a gay son.
The similarities to the style of the U.S. president are not lost on Bolsonaro, a self-proclaimed Trump supporter, or his fans.
""They fought a crooked media in the United States and got Trump elected. We can do the same here!"" Douglas Garcia, a 24 year-old international relations student, yelled into a megaphone at the rally. The crowd cheered.
In February, Garcia planned a Carnival parade in honor of Sergio Fleury, a police officer accused of torturing and murdering prisoners during the dictatorship era. More than 1,600 people responded with interest on Facebook before a local judge shut the event down.
For Garcia, the parade did not represent a call for a new military dictatorship but a celebration of standards of behavior that have been lost. ""I recognize that under the military regime there was less impunity, more security,"" he said.
Some supporters of Bolsonaro cite that same distinction, saying they see in him an opportunity to elect a military-style leader without an actual military intervention.
""These kids hear their parents talking about the dictatorship and claim to support it, but they don't know what they are saying,"" said Maria Aparecida Carvalho, 67, who remembers the era well. ""We've already been through that. I don't miss it.""
The retired mechanical engineer woke up at 5 a.m. to go and see Bolsonaro at last week's rally.
""He supports Brazil's traditional values,"" she said. ""The Judeo-Christian values of our people.""

","The Washington Post; Washington, D.C.","Mar 16, 2018","United States, Washington, D.C.",Newspapers,News,Latin America Brazil Rio de Janeiro Brazil Austria United States--US Philippines Cuba,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/2014088536?accountid=4840,Law enforcement; Politics; Corruption; Rape; International relations; Democracy; Dictators; Nostalgia; Kickbacks; Presidential elections; Murders & murder attempts; Millennials,General Interest Periodicals--United States,"SAO PAULO, Brazil - The military dictatorship that ruled Brazil four decades ago maintained law and order through systematic brutality. Nearly 500 people were killed or simply disappeared. But at a political rally outside Sao Paulo last week, the air was thick with nostalgia for that era of terror.
Several hundred people in army camouflage and police T-shirts shouted their admiration for the soldiers who carried out the kidnappings and murders authorized by the regime.
""Thanks to you, Brazil did not become Cuba!"" they chanted, some snapping salutes. ""Brazil first, God above all.""
The dictatorship-era generals were also accused of deploying electric shocks, beatings and psychological torture in their two-decade-long effort to cement power and ward off communism. But as a crime wave rocks some of the country's largest cities and a corruption scandal engulfs its political elite, some Brazilians see them as the last champions of public order.
""During the dictatorship, there was safety. That doesn't exist today,"" said Marcelo Freitas, a 42-year-old former army officer at the rally who said he was shot in the eye 10 years ago during a mugging. ""If we want to clean up the country, we need the military.""
On average, seven people are violently killed every hour in Brazil, according to government figures. In 2016, the country registered a record rate of 29.9 homicides for every 100,000 people, nearly six times that of the United States.
Freitas, who wore a leather patch over his blinded eye and a camouflage T-shirt, said he dreams of safer streets for his 5-year-old son and would support a return to a military regime.
He is not alone. Nostalgia for the dictatorship is growing. An estimated 43 percent of the population supports a temporary revival of military control, according to a 2017 poll, up from 35 percent in 2016. The figure is especially high among young people, many of whom say they are disillusioned with democracy and with Brazil's scandal-tainted politicians.
Brazil isn't the only country where democracy is losing its glow. In the United States, just 30 percent of people born in the 1980s say they believe it is ""essential"" to live in a democracy, as opposed to 72 percent of people born before World War II, according to a study published in the Journal of Democracy in 2016.
Fear of violence, whether it be terrorism or street crime, has fueled support for authoritarian parties and bolstered populist leaders with tough-on-crime, anti-immigrant platforms around the world, from President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines to Chancellor Sebastian Kurz in Austria.
But the flirtation with authoritarianism may be especially ominous in Brazil, where wobbly democratic institutions are still recovering from the dictatorship that held the country in its grip from 1964 to 1985.
Last month, President Michel Temer ordered the military to take over security in Rio de Janeiro after a spike in crime soured Carnival celebrations. The move was widely denounced as a dangerous precedent - although it was also seen as a smart response to the growing base of voters calling for law and order.
""This sentiment is in the air and is being exploited. The intervention in Rio is an attempt by the president to explore that feeling - the nostalgia, the feeling that the military is an anti-political, tough, external body,"" said Pablo Ortellado, a public policy professor at the University of Sao Paulo. ""Depending on how the intervention goes, if it succeeds in even appearing to reduce crime, it could generate a dangerous wave of militarism.""
For many of Brazil's millennials, disillusionment with democracy has resulted in a rejection of the leftist groups that governed Latin America for the past two decades, according to Renato Sérgio de Lima, president of the Brazilian Forum on Public Security.
""The left is the only reference that [millennials] have for political power, because it has ruled for most of their politically conscious life. That government is being destroyed by corruption, so what is the alternative?"" Lima said.
Four years into a corruption investigation that has traced a local carwash kickback scheme up to the highest echelons of government, Brazilian democracy is facing its worst legitimacy crisis since the dictatorship. The scandal has tarnished more than 100 of the country's top politicians, including the current president and two former ones, and left few viable candidates for the presidential elections in six months.
Jair Bolsonaro, an outspoken senator from a fringe party, has emerged as one of the only aspiring contenders with both charisma and a clean record. A former soldier, he became famous for challenging his rivals and the media to find proof that he has been involved in corruption.
Bolsonaro has paired his unblemished record with a tough-on-crime platform and public statements of admiration for the dictatorship era. He is not calling for a return to military dictatorship, but he has done so in the past and talks up its law-and-order values. In 2016, he eulogized the late Col. Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, a convicted torturer, as he cast his vote to impeach then-President Dilma Rousseff, who was jailed and tortured during the dictatorship.
According to the latest polls, he has the backing of 18 percent of prospective voters, trailing only former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is at 37 percent but may be barred from running because of a corruption conviction.
Bolsonaro has since made headlines for other brash statements, including calling a fellow senator not worthy of being raped and saying he could not love a gay son.
The similarities to the style of the U.S. president are not lost on Bolsonaro, a self-proclaimed Trump supporter, or his fans.
""They fought a crooked media in the United States and got Trump elected. We can do the same here!"" Douglas Garcia, a 24-year-old international relations student, yelled into a megaphone at the rally. The crowd cheered.
In February, Garcia planned a Carnival parade in honor of Sergio Fleury, a police officer accused of torturing and murdering prisoners during the dictatorship era. More than 1,600 people responded with interest on Facebook before a local judge shut the event down.
For Garcia, the parade did not represent a call for a new military dictatorship but a celebration of standards of behavior that have been lost. ""I recognize that under the military regime there was less impunity, more security,"" he said.
Some supporters of Bolsonaro cite that same distinction, saying they see in him an opportunity to elect a military-style leader without an actual military intervention.
""These kids hear their parents talking about the dictatorship and claim to support it, but they don't know what they are saying,"" said Maria Aparecida Carvalho, 67, who remembers the era well. ""We've already been through that. I don't miss it.""
The retired mechanical engineer woke up at 5 a.m. to go and see Bolsonaro at last week's rally.
""He supports Brazil's traditional values,"" she said. ""The Judeo-Christian values of our people.""

That became clear when my taxi took a right turn toward the city center, and smack into what might be the most entertaining traffic jam I've ever experienced.Within seconds, hundreds of revelers, many of them wearing sparkling bikinis, elaborate feather headdresses -- and little else -- had engulfed our car, streaming down the street in the opposite direction. One woman in a sequined, beige one-piece flashed a cheeky smile and began ""wining"" with our front bumper. (That's a dance that typically involves a woman and man standing back-to-front and ""winding"" their hips against one another.)To my left a shirtless young man was grinding up against my window, while a woman behind him smacked his rear end. I was sharing the cab with three Londoners I'd met at the airport, and the woman among them burst out laughing: ""I brought way too many clothes.""Trinidad's Carnival is second in reputation only to Brazil's for both beauty and debauchery. The massive, joyous street party I'd experienced upon arrival, I soon found out, was actually an off night. The real action would begin the next day, with serious celebrants in serious costumes hitting the street as early as 8 a.m. and dancing until dawn on Ash Wednesday.""You can't come to Trinidad and not play mas!"" said Linda Wells, a Trinidad-born nurse living in Brooklyn who's been coming back to her home country every year for 20 years to celebrate. She was using the nickname for ""masquerade,"" a tradition that dates back to 18th-century balls that French plantation owners used to throw (and their slaves mimicked) to let loose before the asceticism of Lent.Ms. Wells is 56 but looks about 30 years younger, with a long blonde braid springing from the top of her head and the rest of her hair shaved off underneath. I had run into her and her girlfriends -- an accountant, a bank manager, a former publicist -- getting ready near Queen's Park Savannah, where ""bands,"" or costumed groups, go to compete for prizes. (A shocking number of Carnival-goers I met were Trinis from New York City.)The custom-designed dress Ms. Wells was to wear, she showed me, was flesh colored, with an intricate pattern of green sequins and a train of green feathers, and would have put everyone at the Oscars to shame. She'd be adding a ""backpack"" of flowing green and blue fabric, splayed out to look like a peacock's tail that was so heavy it required the help of two young men to get it on. Then she would dance all day in it.""I'm with the K2K band. You have to follow us. We're going to be fabulous!"" she said, and sent me down to the park under the protection of her husband, Earl Wells, a field surveyor who was wearing an antlered headdress, face paint and head-to-toe tie-dye. Soon I was in the midst of several hundred people twirling around in elaborate fabric wings, or getting down to soca music with sparkling suns on sticks attached to their backs that shot up 20 feet in the air.Karen and Kathy Norman, Trinidad-born twin sisters living in New Jersey, designed all of the band's costumes, and to join, all Ms. Wells had to do was sign up and pay for her costume in advance. This was her second year with K2K and she was sure she'd be back. ""They're so different. In Trinidad, you mostly see people in two-piece bikinis. But K2K, it's about the fashion. You don't see anyone wearing anything like that. I like the elegance, and you're covered up! We're old. We need it!""Technically, Trinidad had not been on the original itinerary of the yearlong, worldwide trip I'm on for The Times, visiting each place on the 52 Places to Go in 2018 list. In an effort to convey to readers that the Caribbean, large swaths of which had been hit by two hurricanes last year, shouldn't be avoided as a travel destination, my editors had put the entire region at No. 4. Working with data scientists from Kayak, the online booking site, we crafted an itinerary that would take me to two islands that hadn't been affected by the hurricanes (Trinidad and St. Lucia) and one that very much had (Puerto Rico, which I'll be writing about next week).That lineup scratched a few itches: the desire to experience Carnival; to island hop (to me, another defining Caribbean experience); and to go somewhere that had sustained damage and see for myself what being ""back open for business"" really looked like. What would it mean to be a responsible visitor to such a place, and how could I both encourage tourism while accurately conveying the situation?What followed was a visit to the Caribbean at a breakneck pace that I would advise no sane person to mimic. For complicated logistical and cost-related reasons that made sense at the time, I'd mapped out a plan with Kayak to go to St. Lucia, then to Trinidad and back, then off to San Juan -- all in four days.Traveling to Trinidad during Carnival turns out to be stressful even when you're not on a 24-hour, please-don't-try-this-at-home marathon. The Brits I shared my taxi with showed up only to find out that their hotel had given away their reservation (common, apparently), so they came to my place, President's Inn, where we all encountered the surprise that the front desk only took cash. (For me, that meant a trip to an A.T.M. on a dark and isolated street. Our heroic taxi driver refused to let me go alone.) Still, as simple as our hotel was, it was in an ideal location close to the action. Just three blocks away, I found a calypso show called Pandemonium in a dirt lot and featuring incredible steel-pan players from as far away as Paris.I had good luck finding that show, and the K2K band, while walking around, but nearly everyone I ran into seemed horrified to see me on my own. When I strayed from the show to look for something to eat, a young man raced up behind me. His name was Kadeem and he wanted to warn me that I had just narrowly escaped a robber who had been casing me, and who was blocking my way back to the show. ""Be careful of that guy. He's not a nice guy,"" he said. ""He won't bother you, but he looked like he wanted to get someone at the corner.""Later, back at the show, I befriended a female pan player named Lenitia Solomon who happened to be a police officer in another part of town. ""Trinidad is not safe, especially around Carnival. A lot of phone snatchers. Believe me, I've seen it all. Be aware of who's around you,"" she said, before telling me the story of a Japanese pan-player friend of hers who had been murdered at last year's Carnival. She insisted on taking me back to my hotel with a male friend who had come to walk her back to the show. Despite such warnings, Trinidad was vibrant and colorful and edgy, and I loved every minute of it.But I also wouldn't trade the serenity of the brief time I got to spend in St. Lucia. A volcanic island known for its twin mountains, the Pitons, it has a kind of rugged charm one doesn't normally associate with Caribbean luxury. (It's also the only island I got to spend any time on during my one previous visit to the Caribbean, on a friend's sailing trip more than 10 years ago, and has always held special memories for me.) The hurricanes largely skipped the island, though Judith Verity, who owns the Mango Beach Inn, where I stayed, kept mentioning how much more beautiful her incredibly beautiful garden had been before the storm. ""We are blessed people. God loves us,"" said my taxi driver, Barry Augustin, of why the jungle paradise where he's lived his whole life had been spared. ""In St. Lucia, the economy is already so hard, so God protects his children.""While I missed most of St. Lucia's best attractions -- a hike up the Pitons, the sulfur hot springs -- I did get to experience some of its lush beauty. There are banana plantations everywhere. On the side of the busy Micoud highway, Mr. Augustin pulled over at a family-run roadside stand he calls the Creole Bread Place (real name: Golden Palace) that he claims makes the best baked goods on the island. A gray-bearded man named Mango was pulling spiral loaves out of a wood-fired oven with a wooden paddle, while Seco, his daughter, split them open and filled them with curried, shredded fish, and his son, Earl Joseph, who turned out to be the owner, handled the money.Though there are far more luxurious places to stay -- Mr. Augustin has a second job at one, the Ladera resort -- I was charmed by Mango Beach Inn. There's no way to get to its location, in an old building on Marigot Bay on the northwest side of the island, other than by ferry, and one day I came in to see that the maid had decorated my mosquito netting with rose petals. Down the stairs was Hassey's Waterside Bar, which just might be the perfect vacation lounge, flush with the bay and covered in strings of lights. I met a 21-year-old beach worker named Jamal Felix, who described his job: ""I put the beach lounges down, I go fishing, I climb the coconut trees, I use the swing on the coconut trees and fall in the water, I go swimming.""I felt completely at odds with everyone else on the island, from the natives (like Mr. Felix) whose jobs included regular swim breaks, to the many couples on romantic vacations who were spending their days on hikes or boat rides. I mainly stressed out about how to squeeze in this ridiculous Trinidad idea, or sat in Mango Beach Inn's lovely common room overlooking the bay and wrote.As my taxi driver, Domitiana René, saw me frantically trying to post to Instagram on my way back to the airport, she told me not to worry. The island would still be there. It was blessed. It was paradise. I could always come back to check out St. Lucia's Carnival in June and July. It was her favorite time of year. ""I think we are becoming more and more like Trinidad,"" she said. ""Every year I'm noticing people wearing less and less clothes.""______Jada Yuan will be traveling to every place on this year's 52 Places to Go list.

 BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Tariffs and technology. Those two big concerns for the market sense the Dow plunging more than 700 points. 
 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on. 
 (END VIDEO CLIP)
 SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: The president turns up the heat on China, announcing a new round of tariffs, sparking concerns of a trade war. 
 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
 SHERYL SANDBERG, FACEBOOK COO: If we find misuse, we're going to tell people. 
 (END VIDEO CLIP)
 GRIFFETH: Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg vows to better protect users. But is the next step regulation? 
 Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Thursday, March the 22nd. 
 HERERA: Good evening, everyone, and welcome. 
 A sell off on Wall Street. All 30 Dow components closed lower, about two- thirds of the stocks in that index fell more than 1 percent today. Half of the S&P 500 is now in correction territory. 
 Investors became unnerved after the White House unveiled a new round of tariffs that some fear could threaten the trade war with China, the world's second largest economy. So, by the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had plunged 724 points to 23,957, a nearly 3 percent decline. The Nasdaq fell 178. And the S&P 500 lost 68. 
 The biggest losers on the Dow were the major industrials like Caterpillar, Boeing, and 3M. 
 Bob Pisani reports tonight on that selloff from the New York Stock Exchange. 
 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stocks closed right around their worst levels of the session with the Dow down more than 700 points. That's right, 700 points. 
 The markets are clearly concerned about two things. Number one, technology. And number two, trade. Two big issues. 
 President Donald Trump announced he would be imposing tariffs of up to $60 billion on Chinese goods over the next few weeks. No details on which products will be taxed by how much yet. But he did say there would be a 30-day grace period to negotiate those terms. 
 Shares of U.S. and other metals and mining stocks got slammed on news that Trump will be exempting a handful of allies from steel and aluminum tariffs, including the European Unions, South Korea and Brazil. In fact, U.S. steel is down 20 percent since those tariffs were first announced a few weeks ago. It looks like they are not as tough as some people thought they might be.
 Facebook is facing an existential crisis right now. In fact, the whole social media group is. And that's weighing heavily on all the other social media stocks. The stock market has lost its team leadership group, technology, and social media is part of that. And there's really nothing taking its place. The subsectors that powered tech high, which were semiconductors and the FANG names, your Facebook, your Apples, and your Amazons, they stopped advancing and in most cases, they reversed. 
 So, once those FANG and semiconductor stocks stopped going up in the second week of March, the market stalled out because no other sector has stepped forward to lead the market higher. Industrials and materials are suffering from these trade war concerns. FANGs can't move higher without the help of higher volume. That's not happening. 
 On top of that, drama in Washington is still on the front burner. Stocks did fall earlier on word in a John Dowd, President Trump's lead lawyer in the Russia probe had resigned. 
 For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange. 
 (END VIDEOTAPE)
 GRIFFETH: Mike Santoli is also at the New York Stock Exchange. He joins us tonight with some more insights on this decline.
 I think you were the one who coined the term tariff tantrum. Is that -- is that all we saw today, or was there more going on, do you think? 
 MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I don't take the blame or the credit for that one.
 Yes, I don't think it was all we were seeing today but I think that was the added element this morning, right at the outset, that came upon a market that also was already concerned about this general notion that interest rates are going up, this Fed is looking for opportunities to bring rates higher if they can, if the economic data allow for that. And then, you know, as Bob was saying, the loss of leadership from the big tech group, which a lot of investors I think were hiding in because it seems seemed like they could grow in almost any environment. 
 But the tariff issue is a reminder that policy across a bunch of fronts, whether it is trade or monetary policy have turned a little bit less friendly than we got used to last year. 
 HERERA: The volume, though, Mike. I mean, it didn't seem like they were just throwing stocks out the window today. Was that mostly the professionals who were selling? 
 SANTOLI: Interesting. No, you are absolutely right, Sue. It was not a feeling of panic. It was not this mass liquidation of stocks. As a matter of fact, a couple of folks are pointing out that small cap stocks had outperformed the large cap indexes. 
 So, the more domestically focused businesses seemed like they were not caught up in this selloff quite much. The volumes weren't that high. The volatility index definitely got up there, but not at levels we saw in early February. So, it was a somewhat lower intensity selloff than what we did see in early February. 
 Whether that something that means that folks are more likely to buy it at this level or not is not clear, but it definitely was not indiscriminate.
 GRIFFETH: Mike Santoli at the New York Stock Exchange for us tonight -- thanks, Mike. 
 SANTOLI: Thank you.
 HERERA: So, as we mentioned, the president did announce his toughest trade action to date. And as Kayla Tausche reports from Washington, there are fears of more to come. 
 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: President Trump signed an order that paved the way for steep tariffs on a wide range of Chinese imports. The move marks the end of its seven-month investigation into Chinese tactics to challenge U.S. technology dominance. 
 TRUMP: We have a tremendous intellectual property situation going on. So, we're going to get it taken care of. And frankly, it's going to make us a much stronger, much richer nation. 
 TAUSCHE: The action comes as the U.S. is imposing tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum with certain allies and products exempted, and on top of tariffs on Chinese made solar panels. U.S. exporters including soybean farmers, pork producers, and aircraft maker Boeing are bracing for a counter-punch from China, which says it will take all necessary measures to safeguard its interests. 
 U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told lawmakers that kind of retaliation is unfair but doesn't change things. 
 ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE: It's not possible to take the position that because we are soybean farmers, we're not going to stick up for our rights in a whole variety of ways and have hundreds of billions of dollars worth of exporters and domestic producers be punished because of unfair trade. 
 TAUSCHE: There CEO of engine maker Cummins, Tom Linebarger, fears the administration's approach is leading to a trade war. 
 TOM LINEBARGER, CEO CUMMINS: We agree there are challenges in China. We just want to address it in a different way, a way that's proven effective over many, many decades, as opposed to unilateral tariffs which have always proven ineffective. 
 TAUSCHE: But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says those fears are overblown. 
 WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY: I think there will be some ultimate retaliation, but I don't think it's going to be the end of the earth. There may be some firing shots over the bow. But I believe at the end of the day, this will end up in a negotiated settlement. 
 TAUSCHE: A senior administration official tells me this is just the kickoff to a set of multiple penalties against China and that further actions, namely restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States, could be unveiled in the coming days. 
 For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kayla Tausche in Washington.

 GRIFFETH: And joining us right now to talk more about the new tariffs and the impact they could have on the markets and the economy, joining us tonight, Art Hogan. He's chief market strategist with B. Riley FBR. And Josh Feinman is global chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management. 
 Good to see you both. 
 JOSHUA FEINMAN, DEUTSCHE ASSET MANAGEMENT GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST: Good to be here. 
 GRIFFETH: Art, how do you -- do you step aside and let things clear out or do you see opportunities already presenting themselves as a result of these tariffs being imposed? 
 ART HOGAN, B. RILEY FBR CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: That's such a good question. And I think you have to think about that three ways. Yes, I think we overdo the selloffs, and today was certainly overdone. Can it get worse before it gets better? I certainly think so. 
 I think fundamentally this market is underpriced and certainly more underpriced today than it was yesterday. I think the problem with this is we don't know how far our government will go with tariffs down the road to trade wars versus using this as a negotiating tactic. 
 And it really feels like -- I think -- you know, I think Secretary Ross just said that. We hope to get a negotiated settlement. That's the best case scenario. Unfortunately, unintended consequences can creep up on us. 
 So, until something like that turns economic and actually slows the economy down. I'll give you a great example. NAFTA, if we walk away from those negotiations, we'll lose a half a percentage GDP growth this year. That's something we need to make sure we accomplish. And the same thing would be true we got an extended trade war. That would be very bad for the economy. 
 HERERA: Josh, weigh in on that if you would, because you say that although a benign outcome is certainly is not guaranteed, the realistic economic impact may be smaller than perhaps what Wall Street is fearing. 
 FEINMAN: Yes, you look at the move today, while I think ill-advised, it affects a very small part of the U.S. economy. You are talking about less than less than three-tenths of 1 percent of GDP, even if you get some retaliatory measures from China and not likely to have big macro repercussions. And if this is just a negotiating gambit, OK, it will be fine. 
 The worry, though, is that it could escalate into something more and it also that reflects a protectionist mindset, this view that somehow trade is a zero sum game, trade deficits are a sign of weakness and foreign malfeasance. And I think that's deeply misguided view and one that ignores the tremendous benefits that it accrued from the post-World War II free trade order, and the damage that could be done undermining that, and the damage that has been done in the past from protectionist forays. So, that's the worry that I have.
 GRIFFETH: Josh, at this point, we have not had the kind of inflation that the Fed might be hoping for oddly enough as they start to raise interest rates. If we impose these tariffs down the road, that could bring the inflation back, don't you think? 
 FEINMAN: It could. It depends on the scope of the tariffs and so forth. It would likely be a short-term bump up, though. What -- not likely to have the kind of lasting effects on inflation to get inflation back up to 2 percent by itself. 
 HERERA: So, Art, if you have a long term time horizon as an investor, you have a confluence of events that are going on, where you have the tariffs going into effect. You have Facebook and social media under fire possibly facing some regulation. What do you do? Do you put new money to work in those sectors because they come down so much or not? 
 HOGAN: I think you asked the question the best way we should ask that question. If your time horizon is as a long term investor, a lot of this is noise and we won't be talking about it next year. Unfortunately, you know, in the news cycle that we're in, we're going to be talking about these things on a minute by minute basis. 
 So, for example, I think we will see an administration that says these trade wars or these tariffs have adversely affected the economy and the market. Remember, they like use the market as a score card and you will see a pull back from that. I think regulation is probably good for social media. I think it's the Wild Wild West. I think it needs some. I think we'll see those valuations get replaced by perhaps the more normal towards what they're doing and I think we'll be fine with that. 
 Right now, there is going to be volatility. There is more volatility this year than we have seen in any given year for the last ten years, right? So, if that makes you stay up at night, then your exposure of the market is probably a little too high and you should think about ratcheting it down. 
 GRIFFETH: And quickly, Josh, if this is a headwind for the economy, does the Fed have to rethink its plan for raising interest rates later this year? 
 FEINMAN: If it were a serious headwind, yes. I think based on what we've seen so far, it's likely not to turn into that. But that's the risk. And we'll just have to be watching it very carefully. When you rattle trade savers, you know, you run the risk of unleashing the adverse economic consequences. 
 GRIFFETH: Josh Feinman with Deutsche Asset Management, Art Hogan with B. Riley FBR -- thank you both for joining us tonight. 
 FEINMAN: Thank you.
 HOGAN: Thank you.
 HERERA: In Washington, the House passed a $1.3 trillion spending bill, the 2,200-page legislation will fund the government until October. It will increase military spending and a number of domestic programs. The measure now heads to the Senate where it is expected to pass with bipartisan support. And the president said that he will sign that bill once it reaches his desk. 
 GRIFFETH: Meanwhile, a key congressional committee has asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about that data scandal that improperly accessed personal information of about 50 million Facebook users. That pressured the stock again today. It's now down more than 10 percent over just the past week. 
 Julia Boorstin talked to Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg today about the controversy and what she plans to do next. 
 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: With Facebook shares down 10 percent this week, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg weighing in on the data privacy scandal that's raised concerns of users, investors, regulators, and advertisers. 
 SANDBERG: This was a huge breach of trust. People come to Facebook every day and they depend upon us to protect their data. And I'm so sorry that we let so many people down. 
 We spent the last few days trying to get to the bottom of what happened. Cambridge Analytica never should have had this data. They told us they deleted it. But it is our mistake that we did not verify that. 
 Years ago, we changed platforms so apps get much less data. But that really wasn't enough. 
 BOORSTIN: With advertiser Nestle today raising questions about consumer privacy, Sandberg stressed their business model does not put consumer data at risk. 
 SANDBERG: We provide a free service. That's an ad-based business model. And in order to do that, we do not sell your data. We are able to show targeted advertising that's relevant to people. We're able to give advertisers aggregate anonymous reports, never telling them who you are. 
 We believe that we can operate our service with our current business model, continue to provide a free service all around the world, and protect people's data. But we are going to have to earn that trust. 
 BOORSTIN: Sandberg saying she wished that she and CEO Mark Zuckerberg had weighed in on this controversial issue sooner. She also said that they are laying out strong steps to prevent this from ever happening again and they are working to earn back consumers' trust. 
 For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Menlo Park, California. 
 (END VIDEOTAPE)
 HERERA: J.P. Eggers joins us now to discuss what a regulated Facebook would look like. He is a professor of management at New York University's Stern School of Business.
 Professor, welcome back. It's always good to have you here. 
 J.P. EGGERS, PROFESSOR OF MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY'S STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: Thank you very much. 
 HERERA: You know, one of the clips that was not in Julia's piece was the question of regulation. And Ms. Sandberg basically was open to the concept of regulation, as was Mark Zuckerberg yesterday, which surprised a lot of people. It seems to me they think it is a foregone conclusion that that is coming their way. 
 What do you think? 
 EGGERS: Well, I think the recognition in a there is obviously been this -- as Ms. Sandberg said, kind of a breach of trust and the implications that the government and policymakers may want to try and weigh in on that and the implications of that, I think this becomes real question, can Facebook kind of help to co-create the regulations that would be put in place that would govern some degree of control over both advertising and the management of social media on line? To me, the real question is, you know, how deep those regulations would actually go if they were to be put in place, and how enforceable they would be. 
 There's been discussions around things like transparency in advertising. But it's unclear how that would work, who would verify that, how that would be done in any way that would be reliable. Certainly, the government doesn't have the resources to go do that, and it's not on Facebook's interest to take on that responsibility. 
 GRIFFETH: You anticipated my question, J.P., because I was going to ask what exactly you need to regulate. And Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that it was transparency in advertising that he felt would be the target there. But it's not going to be just about Facebook. We're talking about perhaps all social media that would be subject to these regulations, right? 
 EGGERS: Social media and just kind of online media in general. Look, I mean, Google is one -- Google is the biggest seller of advertising online. And if we are talking about ways to try and regulate transparency in advertising, it would certainly affect Google at least as much if not more than it would affect Facebook in this way. Obviously, those two big players are going to feel kind of a disproportionate volume of any sort of regulations that gets put in place because they are the main ones who are selling ads online. 
 But, yes, I think this is the way in which Mark Zuckerberg is trying to push for this co-creation. You never want the regulators to come just after your business. You want them to be coming after the entire sector so that there's a level playing field as close as possible for all the firms. 
 HERERA: Now, a number of these companies, obviously, do business globally and different countries have different rules about how they can function in their countries. The European models are much more conservative than the U.S. regulations. Might the companies try and avoid regulation by adopting some of those European regulations or European rules? 
 EGGERS: I think certainly the risk would become that if -- if the companies resisted this sort of regulation, that the most stringent form available might be the one that's put in place, which would definitely be bad for their business. The ability to engage in micro-targeting, even if they're not selling data externally, but to help and facilitate micro- targeting for advertisers is a huge portion of what makes Facebook successful. And to the extent that there are data privacy limits that go beyond simply disclosure of how your data is used, but actual regulation of exactly how the data could and couldn't be used, that would be much more significant for Facebook's bottom line. 
 HERERA: All right. J.P. Eggers, thanks so much for joining us again. 
 EGGERS: Thank you.
 HERERA: J.P. is with the New York University's Stern School of Business. 
 GRIFFETH: By the way, Commerce Bank and Mozilla are temporarily pulling their advertising from Facebook because of this user data controversy. Commerce Bank cited brand safety and data security. And in a blog post, browser maker Mozilla said despite promises from Facebook executives, it takes issue with the social media company's default privacy setting. Mozilla said that when Facebook takes stronger action in how it shares customer data, it will consider returning. 
 HERERA: It is time to look at some of today's upgrades and downgrades. 
 The auto parts maker Visteon was downgraded two notches to underweight from overweight at Morgan Stanley. That's Wall Street's only sell rating on the stock. The firm says Visteon could be an acquisition target but the level of insider selling suggests the deal is unlikely in the near term. Price target was cut to $110 a share. The shares dropped 6 percent to $113.45. 
 Trivago shares were cut to underweight from neutral at J.P. Morgan. The analyst there says its hotel search business remains challenged. The price target is now $8. Trivago shares fell 5 percent to $7.40 -- Bill. 
 GRIFFETH: J.P. Morgan also downgraded online car shopping service provider TrueCar to under weight from neutral. The firm is concerned about weak automotive industry trends overall and the price target, they cut down to $10 a share. The stock fell 1 percent to $9.80, just below that. 
 Ralph Lauren's rating was raised to outperform from market perform at Cowen and Company. The analyst says that the luxury brand growth could accelerate as a result of its marketing and digital strategy. The price target was raised to $122 a share. Shares, though, were down along with the rest of the market, closing 1 percent lower to $107.66. 
 HERERA: Still ahead, Nike just does it, reporting better than expected earnings. And that could set the tone for trading tomorrow.
 (MUSIC)
 GRIFFETH: Late today, cloud storage company Dropbox priced its IPO above expectations. According to CNBC, the highly anticipated offering priced at $21 a share. The range was anywhere between $18 and $20. Dropbox is expected to start trading tomorrow. It will be the largest tech IPO since Snap started trading more than a year ago -- Sue.
 HERERA: Bill, the Dow component Nike reported better than expected earnings and revenue fueled by growth in its international sales and its momentum in China. The CEO said he sees a sales slump though in the U.S. reversing. And that sent the stock initially higher in afterhours trading. 
 Courtney Reagan has more on Nike's results. 
 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
 COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Nike's strong third quarter results driven by strong international sales. Sales coming in stronger than expected in Europe, greater China, and Asia Pacific, though Nike's North America's sales disappoint. 
 CEO Mark Parker says sales direct to consumers rather than through retail partner like a department store grew double digits internationally, with China leading the way. It is been a difficult week for Nike after Parker sent a memo to employees revealing allegations of inappropriate workplace behavior had been reported and two executives left in the wake of that announcement, though Nike didn't directly tie them to those allegations. 
 For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.
 (END VIDEOTAPE)
 GRIFFETH: Chip maker Micron beats expectations. And that's where we begin tonight's ""Market Focus"". 
 After the bell, the company said that broad-based demand for its memory and storage products led to a strong quarter. The company expects that to continue. That's why it gave guidance for the current quarter above estimates. Shares were volatile in the after-hours. They finished the regular session, though, down more than 3 percent at $58.92.
 Higher selling prices helped earnings topped estimates at home builder KB Home. Orders rose and they were also stronger than expected. But investors focused on revenue which came in late. Shares were volatile in after-hours and finished the regular session down 3 percent at $28.84.
 Darden said that an increase in the number of restaurants in operation helped profits topped expectations. The owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse said that it raised its earnings guidance for the rest of the year. Overall sales, though, were a sore spot for this quarter. They rose less than anticipated. Darden shares off nearly 8 percent today to $85.94.
 HERERA: New product launches helped G-III apparel grow sales and profit above street expectations. But the owner of brands like Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein gave guidance for 2019 that was below street estimates. Shares of G-III plunged 12 percent today to $33.01. 
 Carnival said a rise onboard spending helped that cruise line topped both sales and profit expectations. The company said demand remains strong. Carnival shares fell 1 percent to $66.20. 
 GRIFFETH: Coming up, AT&T spars with the U.S. government. At stake, $85 billion, and Time Warner. We head to court, next. 
 (MUSIC)
 GRIFFEH: The biggest antitrust case in a generation is finally gotten underway. The Justice Department, as you know, is suing to block AT&T's $85 billion merger with Time Warner. 
 Hampton Pearson is at the courthouse for us tonight -- Hampton. 
 HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bill, this was like really opening day of that long awaited legal battle between the Department of Justice antitrust and AT&T Time Warner. Opening arguments attended by, among others, AT&T's CEO Randall Stephenson, as well as his Time Warner colleague Jeff Bewkes. What they heard once they were in court is the government in essence saying that this merger would see consumers paying higher prices and less innovation going forward for all of the video however they choose to receive it, whether it's on a TV, smart phone, or tablet going forward. 
 The lead government lawyer even said in court that AT&T would use Time Warner as a weapon against its competitors and to some degree against consumers in future negotiations going forward because Time Warner is considered to be must-have content. 
 On the flip side, AT&T says the government has it backwards. They have to get in the game because of the likes of Facebook, Netflix, Amazon and Google that are getting more and more subscribers in their online formats and frankly twinning to win the war with advertisers. This trial is expected to last six to eight weeks. We're just getting started. 
 GRIFFETH: All right. Hampton Pearson for us in Washington tonight -- thank you, Hampton. 
 And there's more sad news from the Toys ""R"" Us world tonight. The founder of the toy retailer has passed away at the age of 84. The great Charles Lazarus, he founded the company 70 years ago. He rightly anticipated that the post-war baby boom would create demand for baby supplies and toys. Boy, was he right. 
 He remained CEO of the company until 1994, and the man who succeeded him called Charles Lazarus the father of the toy business. 
 HERERA: Before we go, here's another look at today's selloff on Wall Street. And it accelerated as we went into the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 724 points to 23,957. The Nasdaq lost 178, almost 179 points to 7,166. And the S&P lost 68 points. 
 So, quite a day on the street. 
 GRIFFETH: Indeed. 
 HERERA: That does it for us tonight. I'm Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us. 
 GRIFFETH: I'm Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening. See you tomorrow.

Dressed in a Western shirt, jeans and the obligatory cowboy hat and boots, the statue has become the official mascot for the event as well as a cultural figureforbothDallasandTexas. Surrounded by storeys-high carnival rides, stalls selling massive bacon-wrapped turkey legs, and in the shadow of the enormous Cotton Bowl Stadium, one could hardly ask for a more apt demonstration of the catchphrase associated with America’s largest state: “Everything’s bigger in Texas”. True to form, since its establishment in 1886, it has become one of the largest state fairs in the US, welcoming some 2.2 million people in 2017. It’s also one of the longest, beginning on the last Friday of September and running for 24 consecutive days. The State Fair alone is an event that makes Dallas worth visiting. The grounds are replete with all manner of classic American fairground foods, from corn dogs to fried cheese curds. Screams overhead indicate the delight – and terror – from carnival-goers contending with the centrifugal force of Gravitron and the punishing pendulum swing of Rock It. There are also plenty of sideshow attractions such as basketball free- throwing for those not looking to lose their dinner. On the other side of the fairground is the Texas Auto Show – touted, of course, as one of the largest new car shows in the Southwest – with some 400 vehicles showcased to the public. Visitors can also head to the popular Chevrolet Ride and Drive to tear up the track in a Corvette or Camaro. For more family-friendly pursuits, the state’s rich heritage of livestock and agricultural farming is celebrated through educational seminars, shows, competitions and petting farms. Live music is another cornerstone of the fair, with scheduled performances on the Chevrolet Main Stage from international performers such as Flo Rida and country music stars like Maren Morris. Nightly parades with colourful f loats and live performers are also not to be missed, as are the fabulous firework displays. But for visitors whose trip to Dallas doesn’t coincide with the three-and-a-half weeks that the fair is open, the city offers plenty of other attractions. TOUR DE FORCE Perhaps the quickest ways to get a condensed overview of Dallas is with a city tour. Dallas City Tour’s “Combo Tour” offers a comprehensive look into the city in an efficient 90-minute time frame. The tour takes in 65 sites including Pioneer Plaza, a public park featuring 49 life-size bronze statues of longhorn cattle and three trail riders to commemorate the 19th-century cattle drives along the Shawnee Trail. The second half of the trip focuses on one of the most infamous moments in Dallas’s history – the 1963 assassination of US President John F Kennedy. The tour follows the route President Kennedy’s motorcade took through Downtown Dallas on the day of his assassination, before tracing the movements of the shooter, Lee Harvey Oswald, in the moments immediately after. Among the locations visited are the Texas School Book Depository on North Houston Street, from which Oswald fired the rifle that killed the President, to the rooming house in which he was staying, the interior of which the owner has maintained in the exact state that it was on November 22, 1963. While organised tours can sometimes feel too restrictive, the Kennedy segment was one of the most stimulating experiences I had in the city. The guides were highly knowledgeable regarding the events surrounding Kennedy’s assassination – even though I’m something of a history buff, there was plenty that I took away from the tour – and the accompanying video clips from events before, during and after the assassination shown on board the bus provide a comprehensive contextual overview. SOLO SIGHTSEEING Travellers preferring to go it alone, however, can make use of a number of initiatives and services designed to make exploring Dallas more accessible. Key among these is the Dallas City Pass, which provides admission to four of the city’s most popular attractions: the Perot Museum of Nature and Science; Reunion Tower Geo-Deck; a choice between The Sixth Floor Museum or Dallas Zoo; and either the George W Bush Presidential Library and Museum or the Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden. The City Pass costs US$48 per person (US$32 for children) and is valid for nine consecutive days after the first use. A number of these tourist landmarks are located along the route taken by The McKinney Avenue Trolley, also known as the M-line Trolley, an overground tram system operated by vintage vehicles. Thanks to plenty of funding for the non-profit McKinney Avenue Transit Authority, the trams are completely free to use and run every day of the year. They operate on a loop that runs through McKinney Avenue in Uptown, with close to 50 stops to hop on and off, and pass a number of hotels in the area including The Ritz-Carlton, the Fairmont and the Sheraton. Travellers can also opt for the more comprehensive – but less scenic – Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) subway system that covers many of the city’s major neighbourhoods. BIG BITES Texas is home to some of the US’s most popular and familiar cuisines, from barbecue to Tex-Mex, and with some 12,000 restaurants Dallas is one of the best places to gorge on authentic Texan food. Located just a short distance east of Downtown, the neighbourhood Deep Ellum is known for both its live music and its culinary offerings. One of its most prominent residents is barbecue joint Pecan Lodge The quickest way to get an overview of Dallas is with Dallas City Tour’s “Combo Tour”  (pecanlodge.com) on Main Street, which has won numerous awards since it opened in 2010. The restaurant describes its cuisine as “just like homemade but with slightly less cursing”. Expect to find ribs, macaroni and cheese, and Southern-fried chicken. Lockhart Smokehouse (lockhartsmokehouse.com) is another popular option for barbecue located in the Bishop Arts District southwest of Downtown. Meat here is generally ordered by the half-pound, and if you’re not sure what you fancy you can ask for a small slice as a taster. Meanwhile, if you’re on the lookout for some top-notch steak, head to Nick and Sam’s (nick-sams.com) on Maple Avenue in Uptown, whose 16oz rib-eye will go down as one of the best steaks I’ve ever tried. For Tex-Mex lovers, Mi Cocina (micocinarestaurants. com) offers a slightly more upscale take – it also has AVIATION HUB Along with its plentiful sights and activities, Dallas is also a major aviation centre, with Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) serving as one of the key hubs of national carrier American Airlines, particularly for its flights serving Asia-Pacific. “DFW is vital in American’s network as the premier connecting point between Asia and South America,” says Bimal Vadhani, senior manager of international operations at DFW. “The airport connects a large number of passengers from our China markets to Santiago [Chile] and Sao Paolo [Brazil] destinations. Cancun is also a popular destination for our customers from Seoul.” American Airlines’ commitment to the airport was displayed on October 25, 2017, when after a US$10 million investment it opened the first fully virtual Control Center in its network. The 10,000-square-foot (929 sqm) space sports a virtual wall providing a real-time view of the airline’s operations, which comprise close to 800 flights per day. “The facility is an investment for our team members and customers that will create a better experience across the board,” says Cedric Rockamore, vice president of American Airlines’ DFW Hub. “It’s exciting to see our hub changing for the better.” The carrier currently flies to five destinations in Asia from DFW: Shanghai (PVG), Beijing (PEK), Hong Kong (HKG), Tokyo (NRT) and Seoul (ICN). Rival US carrier Delta Air Lines also flies from DFW to Seoul (ICN). multiple locations around Dallas. Meanwhile, Meso Maya (mesomaya.com) on McKinney Avenue serves delicious, authentic dishes and is an ideal spot to grab a bite for visitors exploring the city using the M-Line Trolley. ARTS AND ACTION Another advantage of the M-line Trolley is that it goes directly through one of the city’s primary cultural hubs, the Dallas Arts District in Downtown – which claims to be the largest contiguous arts district in the US. The area is indeed impressive – it spans close to 28 hectares and 19 neighbouring blocks – and comprises, among many other buildings, the Margot and Bill Winspear Opera House, the Morton H Meyerson Symphony Center, and the Dallas Museum of Art. The museum alone contains more than 22,000 artworks from across the globe – some stretching as far back as 5,000 years – and is one of the largest art museums in the US. If you prefer your art to be of the physical variety, sports fans would be remiss if they didn’t attempt to catch a game while in town. The American Airlines Center, located close to the centre of Dallas in Victory Park, is home to the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and the Dallas Stars ice hockey team. For those feeling a bit more adventurous, the AT&T Stadium located midway between Dallas and Fort Worth in Arlington is the home of the Dallas Cowboys American football team. Both stadiums regularly host concerts and other performances, along with tours that allow visitors to go behind the scenes. The massive AT&T stadium in particular is worth exploring: not only was the suspended HDTV display named the world’s largest by Guinness World Records in 2009, but the venue is also one of the largest National Football League (NFL) stadiums in the US. Reaching 98 metres from the pitch to the closing point of the retractable roof, the AT&T Stadium is reportedly able to fit the entirety of the Statue of Liberty within its grounds.

In recent years, JAC Motors has achieved remarkable results in overseas markets with its ever-increasing product strength and five-star standard service. In 2017, SUV series exported more than 40,000 vehicles throughout the year, ranking first among the industry and leaped to a truly 'SUV Champion of Export'. At the beginning of 2018, S7 models were sent to 11 countries for product test, marking its entrance into international market. In early 2018, JAC Motors was named Top 50 the world's most valuable car brand, coming out top among all global automotive brand as representative of Chinese independent brands. On account of JAC's remarkable export volume of SUV series throughout 2017, S7 received 14,000 overseas orders, which not only validated its outstanding performance, but also brought new impetus to JAC's competition in the international market.
The tremendous achievement of SUV cars export greatly boosts JAC's reputation in overseas market and become a preferential brand for overseas customers to choose, which also makes S7 highly anticipated in overseas market. At this year's Auto Show, JAC Motors officially signed a total 14,000 units order for S7 with representative distributors from Brazil, Chile, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Peru and the Philippines. Mexico distributor signed a gross purchase of 4,000 units in five years, and distributors from Brazil, Kazakhstan, Peru, and Chile had more than 2,000 purchases. Meanwhile, S7 had been sent to 11 countries to conduct product test and started its process of entering the international market.
As an aggregation of JAC's manufacturing experience and technology accumulation in more than 50 years, S7 is a flagship product developed in line with European five-star safety standards by a global R&D team spanning Europe, Japan, and China. It has an ultra-long wheelbase with 2750mm equipped with 1.5T plus 6DCT platinum power, parking assistance plus 360panoramic imagery and other intelligent equipment. It is a tempting SUV car incorporating 108 top plus 15 proprietary technologies
More space enables more comfortable ride. S7 has a large dimensional size of 4790*1900*1760mm. Its leading 2750mm long wheelbase creates a spacious and comfortable inner space beyond the mainstream compact SUV products. 5 seats is standard while 7 seats is also optional to choose, which can accurately meet the space requirements for diversified driving scenarios and meet the user's expectations of 'two-children-age'family. It is equipped with a big trunk with a volume of up to 1358L. All 22 storage spaces within the car are at your fingertips, making it easy to use. More efficient power makes it full energy-saving. S7 offers two power trains-1.5T+ and 2.0T. The 1.5T+ engine integrates three mainstream technologies of in-cylinder direct injection, turbocharged, and DVVT, and has been awarded the""China Top Ten Best Engine"" for two consecutive years. The maximum power of 128kW is comparable to the 2.4L naturally aspirated engine in the market, but the idle fuel consumption is lower by more than 30%. The 1.5T+ engine is equipped with a 6DCT gearbox to form a 'Platinum Drive System'. The combined transmission efficiency is as high as 94%, taking into account both power and fuel economy. The 100-km acceleration time of 2.0T engine requires only 9.8 seconds bringing a more enjoyable driving experience. Higher standards of safety guarantees better driving experience. S7 is designed according to the European five-star safety standard, and the proportion of high-strength steel is as high as 74%.
It utilizes front and rear ventilated brake discs and two-cylinder brakes to achieve a braking distance of 39.4 meters per 100 kilometers, which excels competitors a lot. S7 also pays attention to interior air safety and adopts green interior materials. The new car has no odor, whose harmful air content is far below the national standard. More advanced intelligence creates free control. S7 integrates multiple intelligent interactive functions such as parking assistance and 360panoramic imagery in order to bring users a new smart driving experience. In addition, S7 is equipped with automatic lock, reversing rearview mirror and other functions which are not available on the same level of other products.
At this year's Auto Show, JAC Motors officially started S7 Global Discovery Journey, conducting experience travel exhibitions in Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Egypt, Kazakhstan, and other countries, and having the world to further understand the charm of Chinese manufacturing. Countries spanning this discovery journey are also advantageous foreign markets for JAC. The event not only explores overseas cultures in different regions, it will also allow consumers to fully witness the influence and competitiveness of JAC Motors in the international market.
JAC ranks first in SUV exports, which is a result of its accumulated product quality and strength. As early as in 2013, JAC won the Asia Quality Excellence Award which represented the highest quality award in Asia in terms of innovation in quality practice and outstanding achievements. It became the only Chinese company to win the award in 2013 and was the first to receive this award among Chinese Auto Company. With the support of technical strength, in 2015, S3 successfully passed the EU standard collision certification test, which verified its excellent safety performance. Up to now, all JAC SUV models have passed this certification and been more internationally recognized. Based on leading quality, JAC Motors has received attention and praise from Chinese and foreign state leaders.
In March 2015, JAC Motors signed a KD Assembly Agreement with SAP in Kazakhstan under the witness of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Kazakhstani Prime Minister Masimov. In November 2016, the two prime ministers also witnessed the launch of the automobile project in Kazakhstan through remote video connections, marking the successful operation for another major project of Sino-Kazakhstan cooperation. And JAC Motors has also become a new benchmark among China's independent automobile brands regarding ""The Silk Road Economic Belt"". In November 2017, JAC Refine S2mini made its debut in the Paraguayan government family car tendering program. As a key model, it was placed in the center of the presidential palace and competed with the world famous automobile brands such as Volkswagen, Ford and Chevrolet. Paraguay President Olasio Carters personally visited and experienced the S2mini, and spoke highly of it.
At present, JAC has achieved a global strategic layout in Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Gulf region, and has made great achievements in all markets. In the EU high-end market, JAC achieved market breakthrough with S3. At the end of September 2017, the Italian Ministry of Transport reviewed and passed JAC's factory site review and quality management system review, and in December of that year formally approved the issuance of the S3 EU certification. Since December of 2017, the first batch of more than 300 JAC S3s have been imported into Italy, marking JAC's formal entrance into the EU high-end market.
In Mexico where the independent brands have always been difficult to break through, with the introduction of S2, S3 and the release of brand-new passenger vehicle logo, in 2017, SUV achieved exports of more than 1300 units. The automotive evaluation experts named it as ""China's most preferential car brand"" on the YOUTUBE car channel.
While our cars are popular in overseas markets, JAC has frequently exposed in high-end overseas auto shows and service events to upgrade its brand image. In 2017, at the invitation of the organizer of the Kazakhstan Expo, S3 showed up in the 2017 Astana Expo in Kazakhstan to display a new image made in China. In addition, last year, at the Pan-American Bank Summit held in Paraguay, 60 units of the S2 were selected as conference vehicles and during the Carnival in Venezuela 2017, JAC passenger vehicles were converted into a National Guard vehicle for the smooth running of the carnival. Frequently used as high-end 'Star' models, JAC passenger vehicles has been highly recognized by the local market and customers, polishing the brand.
The signing of S7 mass overseas orders indicates that it has achieved a substantial breakthrough in overseas market. As S7 is introduced into overseas market and JAC has constantly upgraded our products, this global discovery journey will enable customers from all over the world to deeply understand and experience S7 and further refresh the brand image of JAC Motors, providing new impetus for our overseas development. In recent years, the development of China's independent brands has accelerated. JAC, with its excellent performance in the international market, strong technical accumulation, solid overseas layout, and other advantages, has been frequently acknowledged in the international market. JAC Motors is stepping into the international arena on behalf of China's independent brands. With better products and brand image, we will display the new strength of intelligently manufactured cars in the automotive market.

The granddaddy of all carnivals, Rio de Janeiro Carnival is the perfect opportunity to let your hair down and samba your way through the 600 odd bloc parties (or blocos) every year. Complete with loudspeakers, drink and food vendors, blocos see thousands of tourists hit the streets to dance, parade and party. If you'd rather watch, the main Carnival parade at Sambadrome is a sight to behold with elaborate costumes, giant floats and fleets of samba dancers from the favelas (local slums). Raking in more than $40 million annually, the carnival is the perfect place to become anyone or anything.
ADULT ENTERTAINMENT
BANGKOK
Reportedly designated under law as 'entertainment zones', Bangkok is home to the most active nightlife in Thailand like Soi Cowboy, Soi Twilight Patpong, and Nana Plaza featuring hundreds of go-go clubs, 'ladyboy' bars and short term hotels. Nana Entertainment Plaza -- a three-storey complex -- boasts of some of the best shows in the city and is rumoured to be the world's largest adult playground. While not strictly illegal, Thailand's adult tourism industry is valued at $6.4 billion a year in revenue, as of 2015. The operative word here is 'adult'.
EXHIBITIONISM
NEW ORLEANS
New Orleans's annual Mardi Gras celebrations are known for their pomp, colour and beads. Over 1.4 million people flock to Bourbon Street every year to catch beads, stuffed animals and coins thrown from the parade floats. Some daring tourists may even flash rooftop spectators to earn more beads. The float riders are required by law to wear a mask, symbolising relaxed inhibitions and allowing them to mingle with whomever they choose.
MARIJUANA AMSTERDAM
Did you know that you can't smoke tobacco in Amsterdam coffee shops but smoking marijuana is allowed? You can buy cannabis over any coffee counter but only up to five grams. Since it is not legal in the Netherlands, coffee shops can't advertise and are only allowed to store a maximum of 500 grams of cannabis on the premises at one time to avoid prosecution. When you ask for it, most shops will recommend a pre-rolled joint or point you towards the bestsellers on their weed menu.

While the fans have their schedule sorted for the grand tournament, the scientists will be probing all facets of the game for insights into disciplines as divergent as aerodynamics, psychology and the human physique.
We are just one day away from the start of FIFA World Cup 2018 - the biggest carnival of football. While the fans have their schedule sorted for the grand tournament, the scientists will be probing all facets of the game for insights into disciplines as divergent as aerodynamics, psychology and the human physique. The one thing that fascinates the football fans in every world cup is the official ball. Every four years there is a chatter about the ball which Adidas has designed since 1970.
This year, Telstar 18 will be the official ball and has already been criticised by some goalkeepers for being too flighty and hard to grip. The scientists, however, are of the opinion that it is actually more stable that Jabulani - the much-denigrated official ball for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
The ball comes as a nostalgic tribute from FIFA to 'Telstar' - Adidas' first-ever World Cup ball used in Mexico for the 1970 World Cup. This was also the first black and white sphere made for a World Cup and was designed for better visibility on monochrome TV screens. The latest offering is white, black and grey, with gold lettering.
Telstar takes its inspiration from the 1962 Telstar satellite which is still there even after finishing that job it was originally intended to do: serve as the world's first communication satellite, instantly making the world feel connected by truly space-age technology. The satellite was a result of a joint venture between NASA and Bell Telephone Laboratories (now AT&T).
The Telstar satellite was put out of action because of the Cold War, specifically the radiation from nuclear bombs tested by both the US and the USSR.
The ball-design for this year's @FIFAWorldCup is called the @adidas ""Telstar 18"". Nice. Telstar: World's first communication satellite, launched in 1962 by @NASA for @ATT Bell Labs. Dead but still up there, inspiring spheres the world over. pic.twitter.com/Kjf6LNnHYb
- Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) June 3, 2018
The Telstar 18 comes with the latest communication technology. It sports an NFC chip embedded into the ball, and there's even a little Wi-Fi symbol on it calling attention to the tech inside. This isn't the first time when Addidas has used a technology like this.
It used a similar technology with its miCoach Smart Ball, which was designed to help coaches monitor performance. This time, however, the technology won't be measuring things like power of the shot or speed of the ball but offers information about the World Cup, and will allow users to enter a variety of competitions.
The researchers have found that Telstar experiences more ""drag"" or resistance as it flies through the air when compared to Brazuca - its predecessor used in Brazil in 2014. This means that Telstar 18 will travel shorter distances - about eight to ten per cent less than Brazuca - when kicked at high impact speeds of more than 90 kilometres (56 miles) per hour.
This comes as a bad news for the strikers as they will have to generate more power for the ball to reach a great distance but will help the goalkeepers as the ball will reach them slower than Brazuca did in 2014.
Like Brazuca, Telstar 18 has six panels, compared to Jabulani's eight - far fewer than the traditional 32-panel recipe long followed. However, these panels are shaped differently and the seam that holds them together is 30 per cent longer in total than Brazuca's, though also narrower and more shallow.
FIFA would be hoping that the experiment pays off as it has faced backlash on last few occassions. In 2002, it had introduced Fevernova as a lighter ball and had pitched it as 'the most precise ball ever made'. As it turned out, it was one of the bounciest.
The Jabulani in 2010, on the other hand, became the talking point of the tournament with players such as Spanish goalkeeper Iker Casillas hating the ball because of the unpredictable way in which it moved through the air, while strikers seemed to like hitting the thing.

624,2073878982,Financial Times ; London (UK) [London (UK)]23 June 2018: 5. [Duplicate],"
",Financial Times; London (UK),"Jun 23, 2018","United Kingdom, London (UK)",Newspapers,News,Australia Brazil Latin America Peru,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/2073878982?accountid=4840,Clothing; Swimwear; Jewelry; Designers,"Business And Economics--Banking And Finance, Political Science","B razil is paradise,"" says the accessories designer Serpui Marie of her home. ""My parents were immigrants; they loved the tropical aspect of the country. Our garden was filled with colourful flora and fauna, and we had macaws as pets. We even kept fish in our backyard pool, instead of using it for swimming,"" she continues. ""That vivid childhood continues to inspire me and my designs today.""
Indeed. Her mood-enhancing collections, under her namesake label, Serpui, include raffia baskets and exotic-bird wicker bags. Based in São Paulo, Serpui is now stocked everywhere, from Bloomingdale's to Shopbop.
Serpui is just one of a number of Brazil-based brands currently experiencing a surge in global popularity. Matches Fashion picked up Vanda Jacintho's chunky wooden and resin earrings, bangles and chokers last November; by December, it was the site's best-selling jewellery brand. The etailer has also started stocking the Rio-based bag brand Waiwai. Moda Operandi sells baskets by Nannacay, while ready-to-wear label Isolda's flouncy printed dresses are sold at Luisaviaroma. The luxury resort and swim label Adriana Degreas now retails in more than 30 countries worldwide. So synonymous is Brazil with fun that Frescobol Carioca has created an entire swimwear brand peddling the atmosphere of Rio's beaches to luxury jet-setters — for £120 for a beach bat.
Brazil's new position as luxury leader has been driven by the growth of the resortwear category. With their emphasis on colourful beachwear by niche, artisanal designers, these new brands have become some of the most dynamic in retail. ""They complement our vacation offer,"" says Natalie Kingham, buying director of Matches Fashion. ""Brazilian designers aren't afraid of colour but their aesthetic is luxurious, which engages our global customer."" The brands' relative exclusivity is also to their advantage: ""The Brazilian market is relatively untapped as a lot of brands don't show on the international buying calendar,"" says Kingham. ""You have to look for them.""
The domestic market has also been a trigger. Brazil is home to many highwealth individuals (43 of Latin America's 87 registered billionaires reside in the country, according to Forbes), but its 2014-16 economic crisis offered clients a chance to rethink the local market. ""People still shop abroad, but not as much as they did,"" says the fashion journalist and gallerist turned entrepreneur Gabriella Paschoal. In December, she opened a multi-brand concept store, Pinga, in São Paulo, which stocks a rotating roster of Brazilian labels. ""The exchange rate on the dollar and euro has dropped and international goods are now much more expensive. It's made people shop more domestically.""
Importing is costly. ""Tax on importing luxury goods is crazy; Gucci is three times the price,"" says Jacintho, who formerly worked at Vogue Brazil before founding her label in 2015. Her colourful jewellery, which can take three to four days to hand make and costs up to £520 for a chunky, resin necklace, is also stocked at Barneys and Moda Operandi. ""Fifteen years ago, there was no import in Brazil at all,"" she says. ""It's forced us to forge our own sartorial identity. What do you do if you don't have what other countries have? You create.""
Lane Marinho, who crafts 30 pairs of handmade rope sandals per week from her São Paulo atelier, agrees. ""It's made us more expressive. We can create new ways of making things without the weight that comes with years of tradition. That means real freedom."" Brazil's resortwear offers something unique. The swimwear is as directional as it is functional: Clube Bossa sells puffsleeved bandeau bikini tops, while Adriana Degreas offers plunge-front swimsuits with belted waists, with turbans and kaftans to match. ""We have almost 10 months of summer here, so swimwear is not restricted to sunbathing,"" says Guilherme Vieira, founder of Clube Bossa. ""You wear it to have a coconut water in a kiosk by the seashore, to tan in the pool of a chic hotel, on a boat, in a restaurant ... "" And a huge focus is placed on fit. This season, Matches Fashion picked up the swimwear brand Haight. ""Their pieces are made from a crepe-Lycra mix that really holds you in,"" says Kingham.
Fit comes with a price tag. Haight's swimsuits cost upwards of £175; Adri-ana Degreas' green printed one-piece sells for £240; while the matching silk kaftan costs £1,065. All the same, says Vieira: ""The beach is the most democratic place in a country full of social inequalities. What you wear there has become a tool for differentiation.""
Degreas produces five annual collections in São Paulo; 150 staff work out of a 2,000 sq foot space in the city. And while her stockist list has tripled in the last three years, 73 per cent of the brand's sales come from Brazil. ""Resortwear is in our roots,"" she says. ""We go to work wearing resort brands, we go out at night and mix eveningwear with a bodysuit that you can wear to the beach."" Colour is synonymous with these brands. ""Colour has a heartbeat and an energy that reflects our enthusiastic way of living,"" says the accessories designer Paula Cademartori. ""We grow up waiting for Carnival day.""
Artisanal production is equally a focus. Waiwai's raffia and acrylic-mix bags are handcrafted across Brazil. Nannacay's Marcia Kemp sustainably sources her straw baskets from Peru, which are then assembled in Rio. ""Global customers value the artisanal craft; they don't need to say, 'I'm wealthy because I'm using a Valentino', like some Brazilian women do,"" says Kemp.
Kemp, who has recently won stockists in Australia, has her sights set on global basket domination. ""My brand does not belong to Brazil,"" she says. ""Nannacay is a brand with no frontiers.""
Global visibility encourages further sales at home, too. ""International retailers have brought us more credibility,"" says founder and former stylist Leo Neves. ""Now that we have presence outside of Brazil, local luxury consumers and retailers look for us here.""
As Brazil's economy looks set to recover — forecasters expect it will grow by 2.2 per cent in 2018 — these new brands could skyrocket. Jacintho has relocated to London to boost her label's European presence, while Adriana Degreas — whose collaboration with the British designer Charlotte Olympia launched this month — will open two stores this year. But what is it specifically that the global fashion consumer finds so intoxicating about Brazilian brands? ""We have a special bossa; there is no translation for that word,"" says Isolda's Affonso Ferreira. ""You know, that je ne sais quoi, that spice."" Spice: the must-have seasoning for any vacation wardrobe.'Colour has a heartbeat and an energy that reflects our way of living. We grow up waiting for Carnival day'

",Financial Times; London (UK),"Jun 23, 2018","United Kingdom, London (UK)",Newspapers,News,Australia Brazil Latin America Peru,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/2073882710?accountid=4840,Clothing; Swimwear; Jewelry; Designers,"Business And Economics--Banking And Finance, Political Science","B razil is paradise,"" says the accessories designer Serpui Marie of her home. ""My parents were immigrants; they loved the tropical aspect of the country. Our garden was filled with colourful flora and fauna, and we had macaws as pets. We even kept fish in our backyard pool, instead of using it for swimming,"" she continues. ""That vivid childhood continues to inspire me and my designs today.""
Indeed. Her mood-enhancing collections, under her namesake label, Serpui, include raffia baskets and exotic-bird wicker bags. Based in São Paulo, Serpui is now stocked everywhere, from Bloomingdale's to Shopbop.
Serpui is just one of a number of Brazil-based brands currently experiencing a surge in global popularity. Matches Fashion picked up Vanda Jacintho's chunky wooden and resin earrings, bangles and chokers last November; by December, it was the site's best-selling jewellery brand. The etailer has also started stocking the Rio-based bag brand Waiwai. Moda Operandi sells baskets by Nannacay, while ready-to-wear label Isolda's flouncy printed dresses are sold at Luisaviaroma. The luxury resort and swim label Adriana Degreas now retails in more than 30 countries worldwide. So synonymous is Brazil with fun that Frescobol Carioca has created an entire swimwear brand peddling the atmosphere of Rio's beaches to luxury jet-setters — for £120 for a beach bat.
Brazil's new position as luxury leader has been driven by the growth of the resortwear category. With their emphasis on colourful beachwear by niche, artisanal designers, these new brands have become some of the most dynamic in retail. ""They complement our vacation offer,"" says Natalie Kingham, buying director of Matches Fashion. ""Brazilian designers aren't afraid of colour but their aesthetic is luxurious, which engages our global customer."" The brands' relative exclusivity is also to their advantage: ""The Brazilian market is relatively untapped as a lot of brands don't show on the international buying calendar,"" says Kingham. ""You have to look for them.""
The domestic market has also been a trigger. Brazil is home to many highwealth individuals (43 of Latin America's 87 registered billionaires reside in the country, according to Forbes), but its 2014-16 economic crisis offered clients a chance to rethink the local market. ""People still shop abroad, but not as much as they did,"" says the fashion journalist and gallerist turned entrepreneur Gabriella Paschoal. In December, she opened a multi-brand concept store, Pinga, in São Paulo, which stocks a rotating roster of Brazilian labels. ""The exchange rate on the dollar and euro has dropped and international goods are now much more expensive. It's made people shop more domestically.""
Importing is costly. ""Tax on importing luxury goods is crazy; Gucci is three times the price,"" says Jacintho, who formerly worked at Vogue Brazil before founding her label in 2015. Her colourful jewellery, which can take three to four days to hand make and costs up to £520 for a chunky, resin necklace, is also stocked at Barneys and Moda Operandi. ""Fifteen years ago, there was no import in Brazil at all,"" she says. ""It's forced us to forge our own sartorial identity. What do you do if you don't have what other countries have? You create.""
Lane Marinho, who crafts 30 pairs of handmade rope sandals per week from her São Paulo atelier, agrees. ""It's made us more expressive. We can create new ways of making things without the weight that comes with years of tradition. That means real freedom."" Brazil's resortwear offers something unique. The swimwear is as directional as it is functional: Clube Bossa sells puffsleeved bandeau bikini tops, while Adriana Degreas offers plunge-front swimsuits with belted waists, with turbans and kaftans to match. ""We have almost 10 months of summer here, so swimwear is not restricted to sunbathing,"" says Guilherme Vieira, founder of Clube Bossa. ""You wear it to have a coconut water in a kiosk by the seashore, to tan in the pool of a chic hotel, on a boat, in a restaurant ... "" And a huge focus is placed on fit. This season, Matches Fashion picked up the swimwear brand Haight. ""Their pieces are made from a crepe-Lycra mix that really holds you in,"" says Kingham.
Fit comes with a price tag. Haight's swimsuits cost upwards of £175; Adri-ana Degreas' green printed one-piece sells for £240; while the matching silk kaftan costs £1,065. All the same, says Vieira: ""The beach is the most democratic place in a country full of social inequalities. What you wear there has become a tool for differentiation.""
Degreas produces five annual collections in São Paulo; 150 staff work out of a 2,000 sq foot space in the city. And while her stockist list has tripled in the last three years, 73 per cent of the brand's sales come from Brazil. ""Resortwear is in our roots,"" she says. ""We go to work wearing resort brands, we go out at night and mix eveningwear with a bodysuit that you can wear to the beach."" Colour is synonymous with these brands. ""Colour has a heartbeat and an energy that reflects our enthusiastic way of living,"" says the accessories designer Paula Cademartori. ""We grow up waiting for Carnival day.""
Artisanal production is equally a focus. Waiwai's raffia and acrylic-mix bags are handcrafted across Brazil. Nannacay's Marcia Kemp sustainably sources her straw baskets from Peru, which are then assembled in Rio. ""Global customers value the artisanal craft; they don't need to say, 'I'm wealthy because I'm using a Valentino', like some Brazilian women do,"" says Kemp.
Kemp, who has recently won stockists in Australia, has her sights set on global basket domination. ""My brand does not belong to Brazil,"" she says. ""Nannacay is a brand with no frontiers.""
Global visibility encourages further sales at home, too. ""International retailers have brought us more credibility,"" says founder and former stylist Leo Neves. ""Now that we have presence outside of Brazil, local luxury consumers and retailers look for us here.""
As Brazil's economy looks set to recover — forecasters expect it will grow by 2.2 per cent in 2018 — these new brands could skyrocket. Jacintho has relocated to London to boost her label's European presence, while Adriana Degreas — whose collaboration with the British designer Charlotte Olympia launched this month — will open two stores this year. But what is it specifically that the global fashion consumer finds so intoxicating about Brazilian brands? ""We have a special bossa; there is no translation for that word,"" says Isolda's Affonso Ferreira. ""You know, that je ne sais quoi, that spice."" Spice: the must-have seasoning for any vacation wardrobe.'Colour has a heartbeat and an energy that reflects our way of living. We grow up waiting for Carnival day'

627,2073888886,Financial Times ; London (UK) [London (UK)]23 June 2018: 5.,"
",Financial Times; London (UK),"Jun 23, 2018","United Kingdom, London (UK)",Newspapers,News,Australia Brazil Latin America Peru,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/2073888886?accountid=4840,Clothing; Swimwear; Jewelry; Designers,"Business And Economics--Banking And Finance, Political Science","B razil is paradise,"" says the accessories designer Serpui Marie of her home. ""My parents were immigrants; they loved the tropical aspect of the country. Our garden was filled with colourful flora and fauna, and we had macaws as pets. We even kept fish in our backyard pool, instead of using it for swimming,"" she continues. ""That vivid childhood continues to inspire me and my designs today.""
Indeed. Her mood-enhancing collections, under her namesake label, Serpui, include raffia baskets and exotic-bird wicker bags. Based in São Paulo, Serpui is now stocked everywhere, from Bloomingdale's to Shopbop.
Serpui is just one of a number of Brazil-based brands currently experiencing a surge in global popularity. Matches Fashion picked up Vanda Jacintho's chunky wooden and resin earrings, bangles and chokers last November; by December, it was the site's best-selling jewellery brand. The etailer has also started stocking the Rio-based bag brand Waiwai. Moda Operandi sells baskets by Nannacay, while ready-to-wear label Isolda's flouncy printed dresses are sold at Luisaviaroma. The luxury resort and swim label Adriana Degreas now retails in more than 30 countries worldwide. So synonymous is Brazil with fun that Frescobol Carioca has created an entire swimwear brand peddling the atmosphere of Rio's beaches to luxury jet-setters — for £120 for a beach bat.
Brazil's new position as luxury leader has been driven by the growth of the resortwear category. With their emphasis on colourful beachwear by niche, artisanal designers, these new brands have become some of the most dynamic in retail. ""They complement our vacation offer,"" says Natalie Kingham, buying director of Matches Fashion. ""Brazilian designers aren't afraid of colour but their aesthetic is luxurious, which engages our global customer."" The brands' relative exclusivity is also to their advantage: ""The Brazilian market is relatively untapped as a lot of brands don't show on the international buying calendar,"" says Kingham. ""You have to look for them.""
The domestic market has also been a trigger. Brazil is home to many highwealth individuals (43 of Latin America's 87 registered billionaires reside in the country, according to Forbes), but its 2014-16 economic crisis offered clients a chance to rethink the local market. ""People still shop abroad, but not as much as they did,"" says the fashion journalist and gallerist turned entrepreneur Gabriella Paschoal. In December, she opened a multi-brand concept store, Pinga, in São Paulo, which stocks a rotating roster of Brazilian labels. ""The exchange rate on the dollar and euro has dropped and international goods are now much more expensive. It's made people shop more domestically.""
Importing is costly. ""Tax on importing luxury goods is crazy; Gucci is three times the price,"" says Jacintho, who formerly worked at Vogue Brazil before founding her label in 2015. Her colourful jewellery, which can take three to four days to hand make and costs up to £520 for a chunky, resin necklace, is also stocked at Barneys and Moda Operandi. ""Fifteen years ago, there was no import in Brazil at all,"" she says. ""It's forced us to forge our own sartorial identity. What do you do if you don't have what other countries have? You create.""
Lane Marinho, who crafts 30 pairs of handmade rope sandals per week from her São Paulo atelier, agrees. ""It's made us more expressive. We can create new ways of making things without the weight that comes with years of tradition. That means real freedom."" Brazil's resortwear offers something unique. The swimwear is as directional as it is functional: Clube Bossa sells puffsleeved bandeau bikini tops, while Adriana Degreas offers plunge-front swimsuits with belted waists, with turbans and kaftans to match. ""We have almost 10 months of summer here, so swimwear is not restricted to sunbathing,"" says Guilherme Vieira, founder of Clube Bossa. ""You wear it to have a coconut water in a kiosk by the seashore, to tan in the pool of a chic hotel, on a boat, in a restaurant ... "" And a huge focus is placed on fit. This season, Matches Fashion picked up the swimwear brand Haight. ""Their pieces are made from a crepe-Lycra mix that really holds you in,"" says Kingham.
Fit comes with a price tag. Haight's swimsuits cost upwards of £175; Adri-ana Degreas' green printed one-piece sells for £240; while the matching silk kaftan costs £1,065. All the same, says Vieira: ""The beach is the most democratic place in a country full of social inequalities. What you wear there has become a tool for differentiation.""
Degreas produces five annual collections in São Paulo; 150 staff work out of a 2,000 sq foot space in the city. And while her stockist list has tripled in the last three years, 73 per cent of the brand's sales come from Brazil. ""Resortwear is in our roots,"" she says. ""We go to work wearing resort brands, we go out at night and mix eveningwear with a bodysuit that you can wear to the beach."" Colour is synonymous with these brands. ""Colour has a heartbeat and an energy that reflects our enthusiastic way of living,"" says the accessories designer Paula Cademartori. ""We grow up waiting for Carnival day.""
Artisanal production is equally a focus. Waiwai's raffia and acrylic-mix bags are handcrafted across Brazil. Nannacay's Marcia Kemp sustainably sources her straw baskets from Peru, which are then assembled in Rio. ""Global customers value the artisanal craft; they don't need to say, 'I'm wealthy because I'm using a Valentino', like some Brazilian women do,"" says Kemp.
Kemp, who has recently won stockists in Australia, has her sights set on global basket domination. ""My brand does not belong to Brazil,"" she says. ""Nannacay is a brand with no frontiers.""
Global visibility encourages further sales at home, too. ""International retailers have brought us more credibility,"" says founder and former stylist Leo Neves. ""Now that we have presence outside of Brazil, local luxury consumers and retailers look for us here.""
As Brazil's economy looks set to recover — forecasters expect it will grow by 2.2 per cent in 2018 — these new brands could skyrocket. Jacintho has relocated to London to boost her label's European presence, while Adriana Degreas — whose collaboration with the British designer Charlotte Olympia launched this month — will open two stores this year. But what is it specifically that the global fashion consumer finds so intoxicating about Brazilian brands? ""We have a special bossa; there is no translation for that word,"" says Isolda's Affonso Ferreira. ""You know, that je ne sais quoi, that spice."" Spice: the must-have seasoning for any vacation wardrobe.'Colour has a heartbeat and an energy that reflects our way of living. We grow up waiting for Carnival day'

ARMED with four match tickets, lots of paraphernalia and bellies of passion, I joined a group of 16 other Singaporeans to head to Russia to watch the World Cup.
We departed on June 14 - the first day of the month-long tournament - to begin our two-week adventure. Admittedly, although I was excited at the prospect of going to football's holy grail once again, I had my doubts over whether the trip would be a success.
There were concerns among the scores of travelling fans in Russia, with issues such as racism and credit card fraud high on their minds.
Having been to the last World Cup in Brazil in 2014, I also wondered if this year's tournament - this is the first time Russia is hosting the quadrennial event - would be able to live up to the electric atmosphere the Brazilians managed to create.
After all, Brazil lives, eats and breathes football so to many people, including this writer, I felt it would be difficult for any other host country to match those high standards.
After being here for more than a week now, I am happy to note that Russia has provided a very safe environment for World Cup fans to enjoy the Beautiful Game.
Just as in Brazil, the presence of uniformed security forces has helped marshall large crowds, sometimes overzealously, while local Russians have been very hospitable.
What has surprised me most has been the atmosphere and here is where it differs from the last tournament in Brazil.
While every street corner in Brazil boasted a carnival World Cup atmosphere, in Russia that has been contained, with little or even no indication of the country hosting the World Cup.
Even at Moscow's international airport, the gateway to most of the fans coming into the country, there was hardly any trace of the World Cup except for a small banner on the screen above the baggage collection belt.
However, if you proceed to Moscow's famed Red Square, or any of the designated fan zones, you will immediately be transported to a different environment altogether.
Throngs of singing and dancing football fans, mostly from South America, create an unforgettable experience as crowds of curious and giggling Russians join in this carnival.
But where the atmosphere has been contained, the Russian government has characteristically pulled no punches in ensuring that the administrative details of the fans' experience are taken care of.
There are the unique Fan ID passes that were mailed in advance to every fan around the world who was planning to go to Russia. These first-of-its-kind passes need to be produced along with a valid match ticket to enter the stadium.
There are also free overnight sleeper trains for fans to shuttle back and forth between the 11 host cities.
It is evident that Russia, as the host nation, has prioritised administrative and security efficiency over the marketing of the tournament.
Another feature of the World Cup that has divided opinions so far has been the use of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) for the first time to help referees make crucial decisions during the matches.
The purists feel that it is disruptive to the natural flow of the game and takes away the excitement and frustration that dubious referee calls previously produced. Others, particularly the younger fans, feel that it allows for more equitable and fair judgment during matches.
That may have been true, except that the use of the VAR has been anything but consistent.
Before introducing it at the World Cup, Fifa - the world governing body of football - could have done better to ensure that referees have better context on when the VAR should be used, for which decisions and how the footage should be evaluated. Then, perhaps, it would have met its intended purpose and not be a distraction to a free-flowing game.
Lastly, this tournament has certainly not gone well for many of the favourites at all.
Argentina has struggled with only one point from two games, while the defending champions Germany lost its first game to Mexico but rebounded to beat Sweden with an injury-time goal.
The likes of Spain, Brazil and France have all managed to accumulate points but have not really impressed anyone.
So, what is behind this slide? At the risk of over generalising, I offer that the decline of the favourites is not new and the writing has been on the wall if one looks at recent international footballing tournaments.
Are we then seeing a shift in the balance of power in football? Perhaps, but most likely it will take place gradually. You will still see Germany, Brazil and Spain rule the football world for the next few years but the time seems ripe for many others, like Portugal, Mexico and Croatia, to move up the ranks to the top tier.
Clearly, this hypothesis requires much more analysis, and it is one that I shall ponder over during my next overnight train ride in Russia. The writer is a former correspondent at The Business Times.CREDIT: Malminderjit Singh

A few minutes after Germany lost to Mexico in its opening game — not fortuitously, but deservedly, less happenstance than harbinger — Löw was informed that, in three of the previous four World Cups, the team that entered the tournament as the titleholder had fallen in the group stage. He waved off the notion that Germany might go the same way.
“I guarantee we will be in the knockout round,” he said.

This, as the last two weeks have amply proved, is not a World Cup where anyone should be offering guarantees. Germany, that great constant of international soccer, the permanent semifinalist, has gone, to the raucous delight of Brazil and England and the more understated relief of Spain, France, Argentina and the rest.
Those nations that remain should have seen enough to know the dangers of hubris, though. Spain sacked its manager on the eve of the tournament and came within a single goal, and a video review, of an early exit. So, too, did Portugal. Argentina has spent two weeks in a state of existential crisis and sneaked into the last 16 because its central defender scored with his weaker foot with four minutes to play.
Even those contenders whose progress has been a little more serene — Brazil, France, Belgium and England — can have little doubt that the old rules no longer apply. Brazil has played only in flashes. France has conceded one goal, but scored only three.
The most impressive performances have come from nations outside the established elite: Croatia’s ruthless demolition of an admittedly chaotic Argentina; Mexico’s perfectly planned, expertly executed exploitation of all of Germany’s flaws; Colombia’s riotous return to form against Poland.
This tournament, thus far, has belonged not to soccer’s great aristocratic houses, but to its petite bourgeoisie. Perhaps we should have seen that coming, when Argentina only crept into the tournament by the skin of its teeth, and when both the Dutch and the Italians failed to do even that. At a time when the gap between the richest clubs and the rest has been allowed — encouraged, in fact — to become a chasm, international soccer has, refreshingly, blessedly, traveled in the opposite direction. It is more democratic than ever. Nations with less glittering histories — but good coaching, a sense of identity and players littered throughout Europe’s great leagues — no longer have quite so much to fear. The giants do not look quite so fearsome when you see them every week.
Of course, it is easy to say that after the group stage of a World Cup. The pattern of the tournament is familiar, and yet somehow forgotten, every four years. The first round of group games is cagey, cautious; everyone worries that this year’s competition will be the worst in history. In the second, teams cut loose. By the third, when the stakes are highest, and it is do or die, mayhem ensues, favorites tumble, and enthusiasm peaks.
It rarely, if ever, lasts. Partly, that is a matter of perspective: It is hard to see how the knockout rounds, this year, can possibly surpass the adventures of Argentina, Spain and Germany for drama, no matter how compelling they are. And partly, it is natural, unavoidable, a consequence of the shifting nature of the competition.
For the first two weeks, the World Cup is a carnival. The planet is captivated by the color and the noise and the bravado of some of the less familiar nations: the buccaneering spirit and boisterous support of Peru; the pride and joy of Panama; the technical accomplishment, and the rotten luck, of Morocco and Iran.
After that, the tournament becomes what it is meant to be: a competition. The tension sets in. The incentives change. For much of the group stage, there is a premium on winning. It pays to attack, to score goals, to cast off any fear and go for the throat. The knockout rounds are different. Now, all of a sudden, the vital thing is not to lose. That fundamentally alters the experience, for players and for viewers.
After all the unpredictability of the past two weeks, there is a startling familiarity to the last 16 (apart from the absence of Germany). Of the 16 teams still standing, 10 are from Europe. Four are from South America, because Argentina and Colombia rallied. That leaves just Mexico and Japan from outside the two historically dominant confederations.
The instinct is to say that the surprises are done now, that the fun is over, that Russia 2018 will be like all the others: a war of attrition, in which the superpower with the deepest resources — in personnel, fortune, spirit and will — ultimately prevails.
There is, though, reason to hope. There is no outstanding team. There is no pre-eminent coach. There is no evidence to establish, conclusively, that Croatia could not knock Spain out in the quarterfinals, or that Uruguay and Portugal should be afraid of running into France or Argentina at the same stage. Mexico picked off Germany, complacent and sluggish, only a little more than a week ago. Who is to say the same plan cannot work against Brazil?
The test for its opponents will not be technical, or tactical, but psychological. Can they see those canary-yellow jerseys and resist the urge to shrink into themselves? Can they treat a knockout game as if it is a group match? Can they shake off the fear of losing and focus on what it would mean to win? Can they retain that carnival spirit, even in the heat of competition?
Ordinarily, the answer is no. Eventually, history and experience start to tell. But this time, as Joachim Löw would be the first to acknowledge, while Germany experiences the latter stages of the World Cup as an observer rather than a participant, it feels as if there can be no guarantees.

Lee Baker, Mrs. Alexander Hehmeyer professor of cultural anthropology, has done research on the traditions of fairs. Since the North Carolina State Fair is in town this week, The Chronicle spoke with Baker about his interest in the events and the sociological concepts behind them. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

The Chronicle: What sparked your interest in state fairs and similar rituals and celebrations?

Lee Baker: I’ve done research on world fairs in the United States and other countries during the turn of the century. As I’ve done this, I’ve found that there are many parallels between the historical genealogies of state fairs and those of these world fairs and other expositions—so that’s sort of how I became interested in the subject. I’m also a more general anthropologist of North America, so there are some principals and analysis that I can bring to bear to help explain these annual rituals in the United States and the parallels between them and those in other countries and cultures.

TC: What are some of these parallels between state fairs in the United States and other celebrations/expositions around the world?

LB : There are many. A lot of Americans think, “Oh we don’t really have culture,” but that’s not true. When you make that bonfire and burn the benches after the Carolina games, that’s a feature of an expressive culture that’s just as exotic as some sacrifice in the hills of Papua New Guinea. The state fair is another aspect of this culture.

Whether it’s in Minnesota, North Carolina, or Colorado, the fair not only marks the transitions between the seasons, but also celebrates family and community. These fairs are structured similarly to other big carnivals, like Carnival in Brazil or Mardi Gras. When people come together in big groups to celebrate something like this, unique things can happen. Rules are relaxed—you get to break them for a moment as part of a celebration of a larger community.

You can light something on fire in the middle of the quadrangle for a brief period of time to celebrate this sense of unity. So that’s where the fair comes in as well. You spend too much money. You eat stuff you would never eat on a normal day. People push the limits—deep fried anything. That’s all part of the fun and part of the celebration of community and family.

TC : How is the state fair historically similar to world fairs throughout the past century?

LB : World fairs have always been employed as opportunities to celebrate technology, new innovations and the like. This element of exposition is consistent between the world fairs of the last 100 years and modern state fairs. For state fairs, the focus is agriculture. Even though nowadays only a small percent of the population produces all the food and goods in the United States, the fair still stays true to its farming and husbandry traditions and maintains this exposition feel. It’s one of the few times farming and agriculture are raised to a level of respect and adoration.

TC : Do you foresee the fair evolving at all as parts of the United States become increasingly urbanized and a decreasing percentage of the population becomes involved in agriculture?

LB: I don’t think so. I think these fairs have established very durable traditions, so I don’t think the format, the structure, the celebration or the food is going to change too much. State fairs have been remarkably resilient in that they haven’t evolved much since the 1940s or 1950s. I think that one reason for this is that people want their kids to have experiences similar to the experiences that they had as kids.

There’s a generational link—the grandma’s fair is very similar to the mother’s fair, which is very similar to the daughter’s fair. I think state fairs in general appeal to nostalgia and hearken back to the “good old days.” It’s a moment to reflect upon the past or do something familiar that is not necessarily progressive. I don’t think there’s a widespread desire for the fair to evolve with the times. We could easily be playing virtual reality or high-tech shooter games, and instead we’re throwing softballs at milk cans and darts at balloons.

TC : What is your favorite aspect of the state fair? Does your family have any particular traditions associated with the event?

LB : My family has been going since my kids were young. I love gardening, and my hobby is collecting and growing house plants—drives my wife crazy—so I like to go to the exhibits on the plants. My wife is a quilter, so she gets excited about the quilting exhibits. We usually stop by the farm animals and the fun house for the kids. My son loves the fun house. Then we get food—our turkey legs, our corn and usually a funnel cake—and go on four or five rides. We try to only go on a few You can’t do 20 of them, you would go broke!

TC: Are there any aspects of the North Carolina State Fair specifically that you find particularly intriguing?

LB : Well it’s an integral part of American culture, that’s for sure. It’s a celebration of North Carolina and, by default, our diversity. When you walk through the state fair, the level of diversity is incredible. You see the South Asians from Cary, the Mexican families from Durham, the Republicans, the Democrats. You see rich people, poor people, working class, middle class. The full range of humanity is at the fair.

To me, that is a true celebration of North Carolina and North Carolina’s diversity. Everyone feels welcome—spending too much money and eating things that they shouldn’t be.

Carla Ferreira brought South America to Columbia on Saturday with her open gallery, ""Snapshots of Brazil.""

Ferreira, an associate professor of English at Brazil's Universidade Federal de São Carlos, has been at USC as a visiting researcher for three months now. She saw the gallery, located in Hollings Special Collections Library, as an exciting opportunity to share an overview of Brazilian culture and equip students and faculty with the knowledge necessary to one day pursue opportunities in Brazil.

""This gallery itself is very important to me because it is a chance for me to spread the news about my country,"" Ferreira said. ""People, they know about Brazil, but they don't know some basic information or important information if you want to go there.""

The presentation opened with a series of images that typify the average person's conception of Brazil: pristine beaches, vibrant parrots and the lively carnival. Ferreira said that although these may be important aspects of Brazilian life, there is much more to the South American country.

Brazil is broken down into five main regions, each with their own cultures and climates: North, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast and South. Whereas northern regions are known for their warm weather, the south is susceptible to snow storms. In addition, there are slight variations in dialect, music, environment and ethnicity.

""The weather is different, food is different, people are different, you cannot tell what a Brazilian is like. Only when the person says, 'I'm a Brazilian,'"" Ferreira said.

Another major component of the gallery was the countering of misconceptions.

For one, monkeys will not be found roaming the metropolitan streets of Rio de Janeiro or swinging over the buildings of São Carlos. Aside from the rainforests, Brazilians only find monkeys at the zoo.

Ferreira also explained how many people hear she is from Brazil and approach her speaking Spanish under the misconception that it's Brazil's language, when it's actually Portuguese.

A third significant component involved the ability to go to Brazil as a student or teacher. She noted that there are English Teaching Assistant programs in which American students work with Brazilian professors to sharpen students' English-speaking skills. Professors can also travel to Brazil through research programs, just as Ferreira has traveled to USC.

Her gallery concluded with a Q&A session in which Ferreira fielded the audience's questions, ranging from the state of race relations in Brazil to how her views on American culture have changed since living here.

Ferreira, who previously lived in Iowa for a short time, admitted that she was surprised by how different Southern culture is from Northern culture in the U.S. In other words, American culture is just as diverse as Brazilian culture.

""We are samba, soccer, carnival. We are coffee, but not just that. That's just a part of Brazil,"" Ferreira said.

763,2140228924,The Economic Times ; New Delhi [New Delhi]02 Dec 2018.,"By: Annabel Dsouza When your Instagram feed looks like a poorly curated travel magazine, with acquaintances hopscotching all over Europe, and a depreciating rupee makes your own tour plans seem like a financial suicide mission, the motivation to travel doesn't run quite high. And yet Brazil ought to feature in every traveller's must-visit list. While it is beyond beautiful, the current exchange rate of about `18 to the Brazilian real makes it positively irresistible. Don't let the exorbitant flight fares scare you. If one has to pay upwards of Rs 40,000 for a return ticket to a destination as common as Madrid, it is only fair to pay twice that to cross one continent and two oceans to touch the pearlescent shores of Brazil. If you can gather enough travel miles and pay a little bit more, Emirates and Qatar Airways are two of the most competitively priced carriers that will take you from Mumbai or New Delhi to Sao Paulo with one stop in under 24 hours. If there's anything more endearing than the famous joie de vivre of the Brazilians, from Uber drivers to museum managers, it has to be the pristine beauty of the treelined avenues and clear blue skies of Sao Paulo. Take, for instance, the massive Ibirapuera Park, designed by that Latin American god of modern architecture Oscar Niemeyer and located in the dead centre of the bustling metropolis. For a fee of six reals, the Museo Afro Brasil in the Ibirapuera gives a crash course in the ethnic diversity of the Americas. Apart from indigenous people, Africans and European migrants, Brazil is home to the world's largest Japanese population outside the Land of the Rising Sun. Sao Paulo, no wonder, bustles with sushi bars as well as party clubs. It is also home to some of the finest street graffiti by Eduardo Kobra, a contemporary muralist. His kaleidoscopic graffiti of Brazil's diverse ethnicities as well as famous personalities such as Formula One hero Ayrton Senna is both therapy and inspiration. Soul Food There's nothing more exciting for a coffee lover than to be in the holy land of the brew. Coffee, in all its variations, is for the day while nights are devoted to cachaca, an alcoholic cashew brew, which is so strong and delicious that it may well be the mother of the humbler Goan feni. Have it neat or in the more charismatic caipirinha cocktail, and you are ready for the carnaval of life. Having visited the country in the thick of the carnival season, we were party to many public carnavals, where streets are sealed off at both ends, techno music blares and copious amounts of beer and food are on sale. The delicious national dish feijoada is a rich, slow-stewed gravy of black beans and meat, while the quintessentially Brazilian barbecue or churrasco features not only various types of meats but also pineapple and corn on the cob. The juicy tropical fruits, the glittering spread of seafood and the exquisite varieties of cheese and chocolates all contribute to Brazil's culinary heritage. Blame it on Rio The city of Rio de Janeiro is to blame if you find yourself swaying to the rhythms of samba music as soon as you touch down on its frighteningly short runway. A global party destination since the late 1980s, Rio is far more expensive than Sao Paulo but much more affordable than other party cities like Las Vegas or Ibiza. Set aside daytime for the city's natural attractions while you party all night, and you will have a holiday to remember. Goodbye sleep, hello Rio. During carnival season - usually February - Brazil is one big street party. And when in Rio you can't miss the mother of all carnavals at the Sambodromo, a specialised parade stadium for thousands of revellers who come to cheer the dancers who lead the floats. For a slightly steep fee of 500 reals, you can book a premium seat at the Carnaval do Rio de Janeiro, which is not only the largest carnival in the world but is also on Unesco's Intangible Cultural Heritage List. In typical Brazilian style, the event organisers will request you to get food and drinks to be shared with the new friends you will make at the Sambodromo but to kindly leave drugs and weapons at home. You can revel in Rio without breaking the bank. Scale the Corcovado Mountain in the Tijuca National Park in a rack rail coach for a view of the breath-taking Christ the Redeemer. Ride the cable car to the Sugarloaf Mountain where you can quietly observe marmoset monkeys swinging on the branches of tropical trees. Skip the overpriced hotels along the beautiful yet crowded coastline of Copacabana beach, and explore hostels and homestays. Research online and plan well in advance so as not to compromise on safety, especially in the peak carnival season. From the fantastic view of our homestay balcony in the romantic but slightly secluded, elevated neighbourhood of Santa Teresa, we could gaze at the solitary Sugarloaf Mountain against multiple shades of blue where the sky meets the ocean. To be fair, unlike the organised tourism industry of Europe, Brazilian attractions are easy on the pocket but lack the simple professionalism of, say, guided audio tours. Hence, Indian football enthusiasts may find it difficult to cut through the thick Portuguese accents of friendly tour guides in Rio's Maracana Stadium, terra santa of Brazilian football. Clicking selfies with the feet moulds of Brazilian legends Pele, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and others is the closest one can get to these gods of the game. Obtaining a tourist visa can be painful for some, but all things considered, the land of the Amazon and armadillos offers a delicate balance of nature, history and contemporary culture. It is the perfect answer to the wanderlust of value-conscious, adventure-seeking Indian.

[Washington, D.C]03 Dec 2018.",The University of Illinois System-Urbana-Champaign issued the following news release:,"Targeted News Service; Washington, D.C.","Dec 3, 2018","United States, Washington, D.C.",Newspapers,News,Brazil United States--US Illinois,https://login.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu/docview/2148903130?accountid=4840,Middle class; Drought; Books; Politics; Dance music,Public Administration,"The University of Illinois System-Urbana-Champaign issued the following news release:
Forro music, originating in northeastern Brazil, is both a well-known dance music evoking images of the rural countryside and a protest music intimately tied to the landscape and the hardship caused by drought.
University of Illinois music professor Michael Silvers - an ethnomusicologist who specializes in the music of Brazil - looks at the connections between forro music and nature and how both are affected by power and politics in his new book ""The Voices of Drought: The Politics of Music and Environment in Northeastern Brazil,"" published by the University of Illinois Press. Silvers is a scholar in the new multidisciplinary field of ecomusicology, exploring the relationships between music, culture and nature.
Much of what is written about northeastern Brazil concerns drought and its social and economic implications for the region, Silvers said, and forro music is no different.
""Drought is all over the lyrics of this music. Most of the best-known songs talk about the landscape and the experience of drought exile and of being a drought refugee,"" he said.
His book is a series of case studies, each exploring how forro music answers questions about music's relationship to the environment. He argues that answers to these questions can be located in matters of power, inequality and social justice.
""We have to pay attention to the human actors,"" Silvers said. ""I think the primary thing that connects music to nature is the people who make it and listen to it and make sense of it and experience it and dance to it.""
Early forro music from the 1940s-1960s has been characterized as kitschy dance music, but Silvers argues that much of it was protest music. Musicians sang about the drought and many of the songs were directed at the government, asking for help in the form of loans, drought-proof employment and public works.
""It was not just asking for rain and lamenting the migration to the city. There also are some really specific and direct appeals for help,"" Silvers said.
""Some of these songs are very well-known but not thought of as protest music,"" he said. ""The northeasterners were a maligned and marginalized population in the Brazilian imagination, and one of the goals of the music was to humanize these people and paint a portrait of their experience.""
Silvers looks at the relationship between natural resources and the making of music and musical instruments, and the effect of environmental decline. He writes about carnauba wax, produced only in northeastern Brazil as a drought adaptation of the carnauba palm tree. The wax was used for wax cylinder phonographs and later for wax masters for early 78 rpm records.
""It's a story about Brazil's economy, drought adaptation and trade with the U.S. directly related to the creation of popular music and capturing and mass producing sound,"" he said.
The book also chronicles the Brazilian government's cancelation of state-funded Carnival celebrations from 2014-2016 because of the country's economic crisis and ongoing drought. Carnival celebrations are seen by some as an inherent element of Brazilian citizenship, Silvers said, and Brazilians questioned why the government wasn't fulfilling its responsibility to support the parties.
""Here's an example where the cost of drought has directly affected musical production,"" he said.
The book recounts how forro music is a way of conveying environmental knowledge. The song lyrics often relate to natural phenomena that predict the weather or the harvest. Silvers said rain prophets share predictions for the rainy season each year, and they often refer to forro music and its lyrics.
""Not only does this music convey this ecological knowledge, but because the music is so closely related to regional identity, it signifies ecological knowledge itself as a source of local identity and pride,"" he said.
During the Workers' Party era (2003-2016), economic change and social reforms in the country created a new middle class and an emphasis on cultural programs to promote traditional music practices, but they've also created a context in which a pop culture version of forro has thrived.
""The paradox is, the same government supporting traditional culture is also producing a class of people interested in mass-produced culture. We need to understand that audiences and music makers aren't excluded from economic changes and changing values related to neoliberalism,"" Silvers said. ""Isn't it the prerogative of the new middle class to listen to crappy pop music?""
Even with the popularity of a more mainstream version of forro, the traditional form of the music is reaching broader audiences.
""Today, (traditional) forro is seen as folklore, a more mythical representation of the northeast,"" he said.

Treasury yield curve flattens 
Oil prices resume downward path 
Krona gains after Riksbank lifts rates 
Another bruising session across global markets saw stocks, oil prices and the dollar come under renewed pressure and the Treasury yield curve flatten further as participants remained unsettled by the previous day's comments from Jay Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The US central bank raised interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, as expected, and lowered its forecast for further increases in 2019 to two from three.
But despite the downward revision, Mr Powell's comments in the post-meeting press conference were not seen as being as dovish as many had hoped. Moreover, he said the reduction of the Fed's balance sheet would remain on ""autopilot"".
""The Federal Open Market Committee is putting much less weight on macroeconomic headwinds than many other forecasters,"" said Paul Shea, strategic economist at Miller Tabak.
""It is less concerned about a flat yield curve and weak housing than we are. It cares less about slumping equities prices than most participants in those markets realise.
""Finally, it views weakening financial conditions more as a 'return to normalcy' than a sign of impending recession.""
The sell-off on Wall Street yesterday drove the Nasdaq Composite index into bear market territory, defined as a fall of 20 per cent or more from a recent high.
The S&P 500 traded as much as 16 per cent down from the record peak it reached in September while across the Atlantic the Stoxx Europe 600 hit levels not seen for more than two years.
The dollar index fell to its lowest point for a month, in response to the shallower path of tightening forecast by the Fed, while the US Treasury yield curve flattened, with the gap between two- and 10-year yields falling as low as 9.1bp, according to Refinitiv data — close to a recent 11-year low.
Meanwhile, persistent concerns over global growth helped drive Brent oil to a fresh 15-month low of $54.54 a barrel, taking its decline over the course of the week to 9.5 per cent.
The risk-averse mood in the markets pushed the yen to its highest level against the dollar since mid-September while gold hit a six-month high.
The Fed was not the only central bank in the news yesterday. Sweden's Riksbank surprised many in the markets by raising its key interest rate by 25bp to minus 0.25 per cent, driving the krona higher against both the euro and the dollar.
""However, the Riksbank remains cautious as it slightly lowered its interest rate path. It does not expect the next increase until the second half of 2019,"" said Antje Praefcke at Commerzbank.
The Bank of England, meanwhile, failed to stir the markets as its Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to leave rates unchanged.
""Not surprisingly, the tightening bias seems suspended for now with the central bank in limbo until the outlook on the Brexit scenario becomes clearer, which won't be the case until next year now,"" said analysts at Action Economics.
